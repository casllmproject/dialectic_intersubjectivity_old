31572,2020,9,16,msnbc,DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE,"NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: Donald Trump, who used the military and federal law enforcement to clear mostly peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House has shown a willingness to use the military on his perceived political opponents. true And he`s got Bill Barr who has shown a willingness to bend the rule of law around Donald Trump`s crude and extra judicial whims. So, Joe Biden is traveling the only path available to him, preparing for a legal showdown, the likes of which this country has never seen before. true From the Associated Press reporting on that effort quote, Trump in recent months has sought to preemptively cast doubt on the election warning that the expected surge in mail in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic will lead to massive fraud and could open the door to foreign countries to print their own fraudulent ballots. There is zero evidence of this happening. true And the A.P. quote`s Bob Bower, senior adviser to the Biden campaign is saying quote, notwithstanding Donald Trump and his Republican allies` hallowed threats and constant misinformation, election officials around the country are working tirelessly to hold a free and fair election and we have an extraordinary national team in place to ensure that every eligible voter is able to exercise their right to vote and to have their vote counted. true This is the kind of effort that Americans in both political parties used to undertake in emerging democracies. You know, far away. But it`s now necessary here in America because the current president has done so much damage to our democracy that he has literally called into suspicion the result of an election that hasn`t happened yet. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie puts it in a new column quote, Trump would like to obtain a proper victory but it`s clear he`s not counting on it. That is why the most visible aspect of Trump`s campaign for continued power is his attack on the election itself. If he doesn`t win, he says, again, and again, that the outcome isn`t legitimate. Joining our conversation, White House reporter for the Associated Press, Jonathan Lemire, plus professor of journalism and politics at Morgan State University and a contributor for the Grio, our friend Jason Johnson is back. And former U.S. attorney Joyce Vance is here. So, you know, hanging a lantern around my own history, I was part of the 200 Florida recount, Jonathan Lemire, but it sounds like, what Trump is waging and what Democrats are preparing for is a national effort to demand recounts, to legally challenge absentee ballots, to go looking for other ballots in states where he`s close. How much of this is operationalized, Jonathan Lemire underneath Donald Trump`s public utterances JONATHAN LEMIRE, NBC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST, A.P. WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: We all, of course remember, Nicolle, the drama that unfolded day-to-day in 2000 in just recounting one state. And we may and it won`t be 50, but we may be looking at quite a few this November. Cross all the battlegrounds and even some states that might just lean one way or the other right now in those polls. And this is a coordinated all-out assault from the president. And he`s ratcheted up his rhetoric on this idea, the unfounded idea that the election will be rig. The Democrats will try to steal it with their mail-in voting. I travel with him this weekend and Saturday night in particular, in a small town outside of Reno where he had a rally in Nevada, he hammered this home. Basically saying the only way he said, the Democrats could win this election would be if they rig it. He went out on along screed against the governor of the state. One that he blamed for not letting him have the rallies where he wanted. And I should note which led him to having an indoor rally, Sunday night just outside of Las Vegas. One that we will probably in the weeks ahead be watching carefully to see if that was indeed a super spreader event for COVID-19. But suggesting that this man, the Governor was so biased in his efforts to prevent the president from campaigning therefore he shouldn`t be trusted to oversee the largely mail in balloting in that state. And we had heard him make this refrain over and over, as of course. So many states are turning to mail in voting this time around amid the pandemic. North Carolina, because it was the first to battleground to embark in early voting has received more attention from the president. But there are plenty of others and they are indeed. As much as the Biden camp is ramping up their legal team and prepared for challenges, try to safeguard voter`s ability to cast their ballots, the president and his campaign are doing the same. And they will have also an army of lawyers ready to perhaps defend ballots but also to challenge them. And we may be, indeed, looking for a very messy and protracted not election night but election weeks at the beginning of early November WALLACE: I want to read this to you, Joyce Vance, because I don`t want to play it. I`m already anxious about amplifying these lies. So, this is just a sampling of what Donald Trump has been saying. This will be in my opinion the most corrupt election in the history of our country. August 17th in Wisconsin, the only way we are going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. September 8th in North Carolina, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. September 12th in Nevada, the Democrats are trying to rig this election, because it`s the only way they are going to win. September 15th, on his favorite show, Fox and Friends, you are going to see something with the ballots, you`re going to see corruption like you`ve never seen, (inaudible) rig election. Joyce Vance, Ben Ginsberg, who is a longtime Republican campaign lawyer and election expert was out with an op-ed last week. We are happy to have him here when he says that widespread election fraud isn`t a thing. James Baker and Jimmy Carter looked at it after the 2000 Florida recount and found that wild spread voter fraud, rigged elections are mercifully and until Donald Trump not a thing in this country. What is a thing, what is a crisis is disinformation and misinformation and siloed chains sort of information echo systems. This is just a sampling we found today. Donald Trump has been hard wiring his base of supporters to believe that the outcome of the election will not be legitimate for many, many months. What is the antidote to that? JOYCE VANCE, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: You know, the antidote is early vaccination with the facts. For starters, Nicolle, it`s very telling that Trump says he won`t believe in the results of the election if he loses. He`s not making a pitch that there`s a fraud problem with the election. He`s simply saying that he`s a sore loser and that if he doesn`t win, he wants all of his followers to refuse to believe in the result of the election. So, what are the facts that we should be looking at? In 2017, Trump created a commission that was searching for voter fraud and that commission had to fold because they simply couldn`t find any significant voter fraud. In 2016, one in four ballots in this country were cast by mail. There were not systemic problems with fraud. Our military, our service member`s overseas and their families, they vote by mail. There`s no evidence of fraud. This is simply another example of the president engaging in projection and in outright lying about what elections look like and how they are held. Americans can have confidence that this election can be held fairly that they can have confidence in the results but the important thing now is to counter act as you point out correctly, the president`s fake narrative to not give it any additional life and to always introduce the evidence the fact that fraud doesn`t exist. That it`s not a problem when Trump tries to complain about election results before they take place WALLACE: You know and Jason Johnson, they have tied the election result to violence. I mean, two of Donald Trump`s closest allies, Mike Caputo, who is going through something emotional or psychological, it would appear based on The New York Times reporting of his public statements. Told people to arm themselves and get ready after the election. And Roger Stone, and again, I`m reluctant to play this, but Roger Stone is talking to Alex Jones of the Sandy Hook hoax scandal for which he was sued about Donald Trump declaring marshal law. These are comments that are so -- they`re whacky but they`ve got the power of the president behind him because they are two of his closest allies. Jason, we`re going to fix your audio but I`m going to take that to you Jonathan Lemire, I mean, how often do Donald Trump`s allies who all had to lawyer up to sort of wade through the legal morass that was the Mueller probe? Both Mr. Stone and Mr. Caputo. How often do they go rogue? I mean, it`s clear that they are calling for violence in a way that Donald Trump is entirely comfortable with, is anyone sought do hold him accountable or warn him against doing that? LEMIRE: Nicolle, we`re in a new place here. I don`t think there`s any question of that. These are indeed as you say, close Putin allies, confidants of the president. Perhaps not as tight as they used to be they are sort of members of the original campaign back in 2015, but certainly people as we know. The president of course, commuted Roger Stone`s sentence just a few months ago. This is someone who is still very much in his orbit, who goes to that for the president and maybe at times can be half step ahead of where the president wants to be but usually not too far. And I think we are seeing here, it`s all part of this larger package. It`s sowing doubt on the election result. It`s suggesting that America should have winner that night. Let`s take a minute and pause on that for a second, but of course, we know that because so many states are going to do mail in voting, it will take longer to count those results. And the ballot that are cast in person on Election Day will be done quicker. Now, the president, of course, is urging Republican, urging his voters to go to the polls that day while Democrats out of concern for health are urging mail-in balloting. So therefore, there`s a real scenario where on election night, Donald Trump, as the East Coast or even the West Coast goes to bed and we don`t have a definitive result, Donald Trump will be winning and there`s a chance and the Democrats and the Biden campaign are worried about this, that he may therefore declare victory, prematurely declare victory before any other organization, including the Associated Press would do so. And therefore try to delegitimize any ballot that comes in after that suggesting that these mail in ballots are fraudulent. And I think that is part of why there is such concern. We heard these think tanks try to game out scenarios as to what can happen after the election and outside of a Biden landslide, there`s a belief that there could be the real potential for some violence in the streets afterwards, we certainly hope not. But it goes to show the president and some of his closest political allies are stoking that talk. And that`s something that -- not just Democrats but all of us should be concerned about. WALLACE: Jason Johnson, I want to come back to the question I asked you about, because Donald Trump has made law and order and lawlessness essential campaign issue and he has sought unsuccessfully if you accept the public polls that are out this week to depict a future America run by Joe Biden as the threat. It is the current America run by Donald Trump that is the threat and it is Donald Trump and his closest communications allies who are stoking violence. You know, my question was to get you on the record of whether we`re paying close enough attention and whether we`re fortifying ourselves and whether we are maybe for the last and final time right to sort of call out for a guardrail or for someone to say, listen, Donald Trump`s going to delegitimize the election. He`s going to say reckless things. He`s going to urge his voters to commit felony voter fraud but there should be a bright red line at inciting violence. JASON JOHNSON, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, POLITICS EDITOR, THE ROOT.COM: Nicolle, I agree and I`ve been saying this (inaudible) on the show, I don`t think Donald Trump is running re-election campaign. He`s just trying to consolidate power. There`s no campaign here, right. They are not spending money. What he did in Kenosha, what he`s done in Portland is basically ask terrorists to come in and intimidate people. And that`s what he`s going to do on Election Day. I said, it`s like Season Five of House of Cards. He`s going to say, oh, there`s terrorist action in Ohio. I have to send troops there. Hey, you got to go down to Dade County with your guns and intimidate people. That is what the president is trying to do. The only guardrail that we have besides talking in the press about, hey look, this guy is just trying to consolidate power. He`s trying to end Democratic elections. It seems like the Biden campaign is not going to be caught flatfooted. No insult, but Joe Biden is not Al Gore. He`s not John Kerry. He`s not going to roll over when he sees a problem. And I just had a friend contact me about this, he said this popped up on his LinkedIn they are hiring post-election lawyers for Iowa now. They are hiring post-election, so, Biden`s team is already getting people in place. Because they are anticipating a battle and that`s a good sign rather than being caught flatfooted after November 3rd. WALLACE: Jason, I want to read this to you. Greg Sargent of the Washington Post writes this, quote, Trump isn`t trying to persuade a majority of U.S. voters to support him. To your point. Instead, he`s trying to get within what you might call cheating distance of pulling another electoral college inside straight even while losing the popular vote, just like last time. And he`s not there yet, but many top Trump officials and Congressional allies have placed their official duties and the levers of your government at the disposal of Trump`s re-election effort which depends on closing that gap do you agree with that JOHNSON: I completely agree. And this is one of the many scenarios that I`ve` seen gamed out that I thought about. Let`s say Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, come down to a situation where votes that come in after Election Day give those states to Joe Biden, but the votes that came in on election day give those states to Trump. What will the Supreme Court do what will state Supreme Courts do? That`s what Donald Trump wants to have happen he knows he can`t win the electoral college or even the popular vote by people being able to vote. He wants to throw it to the courts. And I think that even the courts as conservatives they may be, they may be willing to flip one state. They can flip a Florida. They can flip a Michigan but if you have two or three different states with a vote count shows, look, these additional mail in ballots will make a difference and they will throw it from one person to another, I think, you know, for our conservative in the Supreme Court would have trouble overruling public sentiment that way. I hope WALLACE: Joyce -- I hope too. Joyce, I want to read you something our friend Matt Miller has this expression that he mostly shares off air. But I don`t think he will mind if I say this that for a while the first couple of years when Democrats would say, but the norms. You know, it started to sound a little fussy. But here`s what happens when norms are obliterated. This is Greg Sargent reporting on all the ways that Trump has used the levers of power to his political advantage. Rushing coronavirus virus treatments and pushing unproven treatments, a vaccine before Election Day, interfering in public health messaging. His HHS changing reports, still lying with the president`s message, twisting intelligence to support campaign propaganda. Downplaying the role of white supremacy. Raising the profile of left wing groups, helping to cast doubt on Russian election sabotage. Barr`s efforts here to release some Durham report which resulted of the resignation of his top deputy. Limiting the disclosure of knowledge of Russian. Sabotage discrediting vote by mail. Validating fake narratives of Hunter Biden. And I would just add to this list, Joyce, because this is a kind of list that I print out, and it keeps me up at night, be ongoing efforts to sort of make China and Iran`s preference for Joe Biden look the same as Russians actions which are to mettle meddle in our elections, another attack on our democracy which is wholly different in the eyes of the ODNI`s report on election interference for 2020. What do you make of our inability four years in to have adapted and pushed back any of these in treaties on critical national security homeland security agencies that are now as Greg Sargent accurately reports being used to Donald Trump`s political benefit. VANCE: The eternal mystery of this administration is how Trump has gotten away with busting norms so easily, so effortlessly and with no meaningful checks. And I suppose one of the biggest answers to that is the failure of the Senate majority to hold him accountable which is the constitutional task that they are given. I think the good news on the horizon here is unlike Bush versus Gore when Democrats had to jump into litigation after the election, completely unprepared, frankly, and unorganized in the face of a very serious issues, that`s not what the Biden team will look like after this election. So, this is maybe the frontier on norms that can be violated. They`ve assembled a really outstanding team of lawyers that is headed by two former solicitors` generals. Former attorney General Eric Holder is involved to coordinate with some of the civil rights groups and others who are already engaged in litigation. They will game out the scenarios in advance and they will be prepared in court. And I agree with Jason`s assessment that the courts will not do gross injustice. You know, it`s possible that a case here or there could be decided in way that I might view as being wrong but when we`re looking at a press of litigation across the country in the face of what can only be seen as a really sustained effort to interfere with the election, I do believe that the courts will hold and that we will have fair and free elections even if we have to wait a while to get results. Something that we should all be prepared for. WALLACE: Joyce Vance, Jason Johnson, Jonathan Lemire, all three of you providing me with my much needed dose of optimism and Jonathan Lemire, in your case, a call for patience. Thank you for that. When we return, deadly wildfires in the west and another dangerous hurricane on the Gulf Coast. Both happening right now as Donald Trump continues to deny all the science behind climate change. Plus, a disturbing new whistle-blower report from a nurse who is raising alarms about a high number of hysterectomies performed on women at an ICE Detention Center in Georgia. We will bring you the latest reporting on that emerging scandal. And the World Health Organization reports a single day record high number of new coronavirus cases. The spikes in Europe out breaks on college campuses and some countries entering a second lockdown. Yet here in Donald Trump`s parallel world, its indoor rallies, no mask required even as the experts warn a return to normal is still a long way off. Deadline, White House continues after a very quick break. Don`t go anywhere. WALLACE: As we mentioned earlier, we`re tracking not one but two natural disasters currently threatening different parts of the United States. First in the southeast, the brunt of hurricane Sally`s destructive power is lurching toward the Gulf Coast. It will likely make landfall early tomorrow morning packing historic flash flooding, 30 inches in some areas. Evacuations are under way. And then, out west, wildfires had already scorched millions of acres and they are spreading. At least 36 people, so far, have lost their lives and we should mention, the air quality there has become a hazard right now as we sit here, the Pacific Northwest has the worst air quality on face of the planet. So bad, in fact, just in the last 20 minutes ESPN reported that the Major League Baseball games scheduled tonight between the Mariners and the Giants in Seattle has been postponed. Let`s bring in Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon who drove 600 miles through his state to survey the devastation and talk to people impacted by the fires. I read about that and I wanted to ask you about your drive since I saw that. Tell me what you saw and tell me how your state is doing. SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): Nicolle, I went 600 miles and I never got out of the smoke it was absolutely apocalyptic. I was meeting with folks who are fire command. Meeting with Senators where people fire refugees were picking up clothing and personal items and trying to get hotel vouchers. And I visited two towns. One of them, you have there I think that`s Talent in Phoenix that there absolutely incinerated. It`s like they had been fire bombed. It was apocalyptic, it wasn`t unanticipated though, because year after year our fires have been getting so much worse with climate change. WALLACE: Well, senator, the president within California this week and talking about one of the factors of forest management. I think upwards of 57 percent of the forest lands are federal lands, so maybe he`ll bring up the next time he visits, but talk about the climate denial that still happens sadly in my former party and how that hinders the efforts to do anything, to help these states from having this happen year after year. MERKLEY: Well, you mentioned forest management, and that is a factor and we have been pushing for more funds to thin the second growth forest which the trees are two close to together. Their crowns are all the same level. They are great for fires, they are terrible ecosystems, they are not even good for timber harvest, because of the fire that they posed, fire hazard they pose. But every time we push for funds to make the forest more resilient, and thinning thus applies saw logs, Republicans step in and say, no, let`s get rid of all the laws, environmental laws let`s go back to clear cutting. Clear cutting just perpetuates the same problem, trees too close together all at the same height. So, Mr. President, come to our assistance with a billion dollars a year for responsible forest thinning. It will help the forest industry. It will help our forest fire resilient. But I can tell no amount of thinning would have stopped the fires at this moment, because you`re getting more dusty wind with the changing climate and the forests were so dry. Drier than you would get with a two by four that had been dried in a kiln. So, any kind of spark just sets it off. And then the winds just blow it into a blow torch and it came down the valleys to hit those towns. So, we have the short range. We need to have a massive help for these families they have lost everything. They need us to give them the resources to get back on their feet and we need to rebuild these communities. So, again, Mr. President, help us do those two things for the communities and for the families. But in addition to forest management, we have to take on carbon dioxide and we have to take on methane. And the president is doing the opposite. He is setting the stage for the destruction of our planet. We`re seeing it with the hurricanes that you`re noting. We are seeing it with the fires. We are seeing it with the more acidic ocean affecting our fisheries. We are seeing it with the declining water in the snow pack and the cascades that provides summer irrigation for our farmers. We`re seeing it everywhere we have got to rapidly go to renewable energy and get off the carbon dioxide and fossil fuels. WALLACE: Senator, I`m looking at these pictures of your state and my thoughts, my heart goes out to every one affected but my thoughts are going to how you rebuild with a president who so disdainful of disasters that happen in places that aren`t full of his supporters and I`m thinking of Puerto Rico which struggled for a very long time after it was hit by a hurricane. I`m thinking of his attitude and his posture toward the state of New York as we suffer tens of thousands of deaths from coronavirus and I`m looking at these pictures from California, Oregon and Washington State. I`m wondering if you have plan if the president isn`t at the table as a partner to help you rebuild. And in the short term, I have a son starting third grade it was already going to be hard for people in California, Washington and Oregon to start school remotely with the pandemic, how do you make sure that kids don`t lose a whole school year if you`ve had all these evacuations from the fires. MERKLEY: Absolutely. I talked to parents who were coming out of Phoenix and Talent, they were planning to go 30 or 40 miles to a friend`s house, relative`s house, their kids would just -- most have started schools, their laptops or tablet had just been burned up, there`s kind of a traumatic shock that sets in. the parents have every possible thing they have to -- even their jobs were taken because if they worked at places in the commercial sectors burned, they lost those jobs. So, it`s going to be really, really hard on these children. I was already going to be really hard imagine kids in first grade trying to operate through a tablet or a teacher trying to teach through a tablet. It`s already going to be hard. I picture the president coming to those burned out towns and tossing out a roll of paper towels, like he did in Puerto Rico. I went to Puerto Rico eight months after the disaster. It was such a failure of the United States to assist U.S. citizens in rebuilding. We cannot allow that to happen in disasters like this. I`m hoping we can take the disaster in red states and blue states we have problems in Iowa, Louisiana is going to be hard hit. Texas has been hard hit. Let`s quit putting a party on it and all help each other out. And quite frankly in terms of rebuilding the housing and so forth, I think we are going to have to look for a lot of help from the next administration. I don`t think this administration has competence to get the job done. WALLACE: Senator Jeff Merkley, we will stay on the story. Please keep coming back and letting us know how your state is doing. It`s unbelievable. MERKLEY: Thank you, Nicolle. WALLACE: Unbelievable scenes there. Thank you so much. When we return, we`ll have breaking news, a disturbing whistleblower report that alleges a high rate of questionable hysterectomies performed on immigrant women in an ICE detention center, a remarkable and troubling story after a very short break. Don`t go anywhere. WALLACE: Nurse says a detained woman told her they didn`t fully understand why they were undergoing hysterectomies and that one doctor in particular raised red flags among the nurses at the facility. My colleague, NBC`s Julia Ainsley, has been reporting on the story and she joins us now. Julia, tell me what we know. This is. This is -- we should just be sort of showing our work here. This has been swirling around on social media for a couple of days. NBC has now -- you have confirmed this story and you`ve got some new reporting. Tell us all about it. JULIA AINSLEY, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Our new reporting, Nicolle, is based on conversations with four lawyers who represented clients in this facility over the past three years. They are able to really broaden this story out and explain why the whistleblower, Dawn Wooten, heard what she did. These lawyers tell us that they knew of women who said that they were afraid to go to this doctor. They identified him. His name is Mahendra Amin. He`s a gynecologist in Douglas, Georgia. These women will be taken from the facility to his practice. Some said that they came back bruised, that he was overly harsh, they called him abusive, and some of the allegations that the lawyers told us. And in at least two cases, there were women who were told that they needed a hysterectomy because they had cancer. One of these women, her medical records has not indicated that she ever had a biopsy to indicate that she had cancer. In another case, a lawyer told me that his client had a hysterectomy because she was told she had a stage four cervical cancer. After the hysterectomy, when she went to an oncologist, the oncologist said, you do not have cancer. So, these are alarming allegations about this doctor. I personally called the doctor`s office. As soon as I identified myself as a reporter, I heard a click, the phone hung up. Clearly, there are people reaching out with the same questions we have today. My colleague Jacob Soboroff today interviewed Dawn Wooten, the whistleblower that began this entire chain of events that has revealed this information. Here is what she had to tell Jacob today. I should warn viewers ahead of this. What she has to say is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACOB SOBOROFF, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: You`re quoting the complaint as saying that`s his specialty, he`s the uterus collector. Is that how the people refer to this doctor? DAWN WOOTEN, FORMER NURSE, IRWIN COUNTY DETENTION CENTER: That`s how the detainees referred to this position. They referred to him -- I had a detainee that asked me, she said, what is he doing? Collecting all of our uteruses? Then I just look at her puzzled because I didn`t have an answer. I did accompany them on the procedures and it is mind blowing and is mind boggling. When you`re getting your vehicle after a 12-hour shift and you cry yourself home and you`re the only one in the vehicle asking why, what is going on, what is happening, I don`t have an answer why is nobody not hearing them or taking them so to speak seriously. I don`t have an answer. So, shift after shift. Then it gets to be to where you don`t want to report to work because you don`t have an answer. You don`t have a reason and they`re going to ask you why. (END VIDEO CLIP) AINSLEY: Now, Nicolle, ICE had said that they don`t comment on allegations that have been brought to their inspector general just like this whistleblower complaint was. But they say that in general, anonymous, unproven allegations made without any fact-checkable specifics should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve. So they are clearly questioning Dawn Wooten here. But so far, ICE has not responded to the new reporting by NBC News that calls out this doctor by name and gives specific allegations that clients gave their lawyers. The other thing we`re waiting for them to respond to, as well as the company that runs the facility, is the allegations from the lawyers that they say they went to leadership, to management at this facility and said, look, you have a problem with this doctor, our clients are afraid to go back to them, he`s hurting these women. And they continued for years to keep using this gynecologist to perform this care. Right now, ICE has not responded to that new reporting. WALLACE: Julia, can you widen the lens on the medical care that is standard for female detainees? It just sounds like a whole lot of gynecological care when we read about the complete and abject neglect around COVID. AINSLEY: You`re hitting it. These are the conversations I`ve been having all day, Nicolle. I mean, I`ve been talking to lawyers who say, look, I have clients in detention who had diabetes and couldn`t get their medication, yet they were told to go back for a pap smear and then to go again when that seemed irregular. It seemed like they were getting way too much care from a gynecologist and perhaps doing very unnecessary procedures and not enough of what you would need in a short term detention situation. We know that they aren`t supposed to stay longer than six months. Why were they getting so much care on this one area? I will also point out that this doctor was part of a civil settlement with the Justice Department in 2015, where he and other doctors had to pay over $500,000 and a fine for fraudulent claims to Medicaid. So that means that we`re already looking at a doctor who has at least been, you know, alleged to have tried to inflate his claims in order to get more money. That, I think, is the allegation here, why was he doing so much work if as it seems a lot of these procedures were not necessary. I should also mention, very tragic, one of the lawyers described a woman of childbearing age who has now had a hysterectomy that perhaps she did not need. WALLACE: It has been unbelievably disturbing. It sounds like the tip of the iceberg. Julia Ainsley, please come back as you and Jacob report more on this story. When we come back, the coronavirus hits a record high in new infections around the world, but in Donald Trump`s parallel reality, it is indoor rallies, no masks, no social distancing. We`ll bring you all that reporting. ""Deadline: White House"" will back after a quick break. WALLACE: There are already taking on an air of the frost Nixon tapes. That was Donald Trump with Bob Woodward back in April. His comments there to Bob Woodward is a far cry from what Donald Trump is telling the rest of the country publicly. And under Trump, the United States continues to lead the world in the number of coronavirus infections and deaths. That since the threat of a resurgence increases overseas. Globally, more than 29 million cases have been reported and more than 928 people have died. On Sunday, the World Health Organization reported more than 308,000 new infections, the most in one day since the pandemic began. More than half are from three countries. India, Brazil, and you guessed it, the United States of America. Cases are spiking in Europe, as well, especially in Spain and France, as the WHO warns the entire continent should prepare for increased mortality this fall. This Friday, Israel will become the first developed country to enter a second nationwide lockdown amid an infection rate that is one of the world`s highest. Joining our conversation, internal medicine physician and MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Lipi Roy, plus former White House communications director under President Obama, Jen Palmieri is here. Dr. Roy, I want to ask you about these global headlines. I guess my question is some of these countries did everything right. Spain had one of the most strict lockdowns the world over and they are dealing now with an uptick in cases and morality. What does that tell us about the virus? LIPI ROY, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR, INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: Nicolle, it`s good to be with you under such surreal and at times really heartbreaking circumstances. WALLACE: Yeah. ROY: Yeah, what we`re seeing in other countries is frankly what we`re seeing in parts of this country, as well, right? And so certain states, just like certain countries, if they reopen too quickly without the appropriate health measures in place, they are going to get infections again. There is still widespread, community spread of this virus all over the country. Again, certain parts of this country such as the northeast, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York have been able to successfully lower the community spread. And by the way, other countries like up north in my homeland of Canada, which just announced zero deaths for the first time in six months. So it`s doable but it has to happen very carefully and following guidelines, strict guidelines. So the leaders of these counties have to work side by side with their public held officials and communicate this message throughout the country, in the smaller village, to large cities, to everyone because everyone is vulnerable, frankly, Nicolle. WALLACE: I want to read you, Dr. Roy, some of the headlines about what back to school has brought. In Michigan, there are 11 K through 12 schools with outbreak, adding up to more than 1,400 cases. Michigan State University ordered 30 fraternities and sororities to quarantine after an outbreak. Utah`s top epidemiologist called out college students for the uptick for partying and socializing. This is in New York City where, as you mentioned, one of the lowest infection rates in our country. Fifty-five New York City Department of Education employees tested positive one week before classes began and nearly half of all New York City public students are opting for all remote. There are a lot kids who need the lunch program, who have special -- that`s just a remarkable number of public school students in a part of the country that`s doing quite well opting out of going into schools. ROY: I mean, it`s so frustrating because as you just so accurately pointed out, Nicolle, school is so essential not only for education, obviously, but all the other services that schools provide, including health services, including food and meal programs, after school programs, many, many reasons. However, schools can only reopen if it`s done so safely. As you know, Nicolle, schools are embedded in communities. So if that community has a high community spread of the virus, you`re going to see that in the schools and then back into the community. But to your point, even in areas like New York City and New York State where community spread is low, we`re still seeing cases. So, you know, we already have data showing that kids can not only get infected but transmit the virus to each other and to adults and going back to their homes to their grandparents. So, you know, it means going back to the drawing board, Nicolle, and making sure that all of these schools, either have do it remotely or if they are going to do it in person, it has to be with distance between the desks and good ventilation, but it has to be very clear cut instructions, Nicolle. WALLACE: You know, Jen Palmieri, when I saw the pictures of Donald Trump`s indoor rallies this week, I wondered if there were any kids in any of those households, what they were doing, right? Like so were the parents or grandparents or aunts and uncles out maskless, not socially distancing, and then enforcing other rules for their kids. I mean, this parallel reality that Trump is imposing on his supporters goes against every recommendation his own government still has in place. JENNIFER PALMIERI, FORMER CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah. I mean, first of all, like this week, we`ll probably pass 200,000 deaths. We`ll probably hit that tragic milestone. It is so chilling about hearing his voice with Woodward. He sounded like a rational person would in discussing the virus, right? He sounds like everyone on this show in appreciating how serious it is and how easily it is transmitted, and then when he speaks to the public, he adopts some other tone that is not just lying to America and then putting his own supporters in this kind of vulnerability, right? It is just -- it is mind-boggling irresponsible. And I fear what he`s trying to do now that COVID is (INAUDIBLE) because of Woodward. What he`s trying to do at these rallies is show America, look, everything is normal, everything is fine, and willing to put his own supporters at risk just to make it look as if -- just to have the appearance as if things were returning to normal. And, you know, we also saw what happened when he did this in Tulsa in June. We think that`s where Herman Cain got -- contracted COVID-19 and died shortly thereafter. This is life and death (INAUDIBLE) as a political game. WALLACE: It is amazing. Jen Palmieri, what you describe is him basically viewing his supporters as extras in campaign footage to show a fake America where people are not at risk of a deadly pandemic. It really is chilling when you put it that way. Jen Palmieri, Dr. Lipi Roy, thank you both for spending some time with us. When we return, remembering lives well lived. WALLACE: It takes a special kind of person to dedicate a lifetime to helping others. That was Reva June Booth. She was raised in a dirt floor cabin in a dirt poor coalmining town. She had eight siblings. When she was a teenager, it fell to her to watch over them. So, she dropped out of high school, put everything on hold just to help her family. It was the first chapter in a life spent serving those in need. It wasn`t long before Reva moved to Detroit, got her GED, and a job as a paraprofessional. From there, according to the Detroit Free Press, Reva became a living caregiver for older folks with no family. Reva had three daughters of her own and grandchildren and great grandchildren. They all knew her as ""granny,"" a loving woman for whom an empty plate at the dinner table always meant stay right there, don`t move, there is more. Reva died of the coronavirus at the age of 86 after a life very well lived indeed. She`s in our thoughts and prayers. We`ll be right back. WALLACE: Thank you for letting us into your homes during these extraordinary times. We are grateful for that. ""THE BEAT"" with my friend Ari Melber starts right now. Hi, Ari.

31185,2020,8,26,msnbc,11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS,"BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST: The case for a second Trump term came from the First Lady, member of the cabinet, two of his children as well as political allies, various supporters. Notably the White House was used as a prop in a soundstage for tape segments. true The reviews of his administration`s record were often at odds with reality, especially the pandemic, and came with a hefty dose of revisionism. But especially notable, as we said, the use of official government functions and backdrops and property on a night devoted to the President`s reelection. More on all of that in a moment, but first, here`s a look at what we saw and heard tonight. true (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) true SEN.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let us join our president and his vow that America will never be a socialist country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, you`re now a citizen of United States of America. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This President has led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world. ERIC TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP`S SON: Peace in the Middle East, never any wars were finally ended, promises made and promises for the first time were kept. MELANIA TRUMP, U.S. FIRST LADY: If you tell him he cannot be done, he just works harder. I believe that we need my husband`s leadership now more than ever, in order to bring us back once again to the greatest economy and the strongest country ever known. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Tonight`s televised session started with a prayer that mentioned Jacob Blake, the 29-year old man who was repeatedly shot in the back seven times in fact point blank range by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin this past Sunday. Protest broke out there for a third straight night. The governor has increased the National Guard presence on the streets. Those barricades were just put up this afternoon. Blake`s family now says he`s paralyzed from the waist down remains hospitalized. Today his parents spoke out for the first time to address the shooting and the protests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACOB BLAKE, SR. JACOB BLAKE`S FATHER: They shot my son seven times, seven times. Lucky didn`t matter. But my son matters. JULIA JACKSON, JACOB BLAKE`S MOTHER: Let`s use our hearts, our love and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: His mother was extraordinary today. A state investigation into the shooting is underway. Today, the U.S. Justice Department announced it plans to assist in that inquiry. It`s a lot to take on but here with us for our leadoff discussion, two Pulitzer Prize recipients from the Washington Post. Phil Rucker, White House Bureau Chief for the Post, co-author with his colleague Carol Leonnig of the best seller, A Very Stable Genius. And Mary Jordan, National Political Correspondent at the Post and author of The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump, published in June. Importantly, she`s also co-author of Trump on Trial: The Investigation, Impeachment, Acquittal and Aftermath which came out just today. Plus, for good measure, our friend John Heilemann, author, journalist, our National Affairs Analyst, co-host of the Circus on Showtime, Executive Editor over at the Recount. It`s a lot but we`re happy to have you. Thanks for staying up with us and welcome to the three of you. Mr. Rucker, I`d like to begin with your beats specifically. Again, this was supposed to be after criticizing the darkness as he saw it of the Democrats gathering. This was supposed to be positive stories. Are you reporting? Are you hearing even a hint of remorse over the use of the levers, the symbolism, the real estate that comes with our presidency for this television presentation tonight? PHILIP RUCKER, THE WASHINGTON POST WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF: Brian, I`m hearing zero remorse. You know, this was a controversy in the weeks leading up to the convention when the President made it known that he intended to use the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday night for his formal acceptance speech. And you know, he almost invites the controversy. He`s almost daring the authorities that exists to try to challenge him on the law here and on the ethics here. There`s no question in my mind and based on my reporting that all of the uses of the White House buildings that Secretary Pompeo, his trip to Israel, all the other uses of federal resources behind this convention, that the people making those decisions knew what they were doing, and did so anyways. You know, they`re trying to show the power of incumbency here. They`re trying to put the President in the job to show him, you know, walking down the colonnade today to show him leading that immigration ceremony that pardoning ceremony, to show the Secretary of State in Jerusalem, to try to add to the grandeur of the convention and impress upon voters, that these are the people really in charge leading the country, but it is an absolute break with president in this country. It is alarming to most ethics, scholars and others who keep an eye on these things. And it is yet another norm that this President has busted through. WILLIAMS: Mary, it`s great to have you. Let`s talk about the First Lady`s speech this afternoon, her press secretary said in effect, unlike 2016, this speech was all hers, as it was put all her words, no input this time from Michelle Obama. I know to write about someone you have to kind of occupy their headspace and live with your lead character, having just come off that process. I`m wondering what went through your mind watching tonight? MARY JORDAN, THE WASHINGTON POST NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it was almost like -- Well, first of all, is the biggest speech of her life. And if they don`t win November, I think she was thinking, you know, I need to tell people who I am. Time and time again. She was saying things that her husband would never say, social media was her big message, right? And he uses social media, to bully people. And of course, she brought that up again, and talked about being civil. She talked about compassion. She talked about pretty much everything he didn`t. You know, the victims of hurricanes and of course, you know, the anxiety and all the problems including suicide, which you mentioned that have come off of coronavirus, is completely discordant. And she was basically saying in by far the longest speech that she`s ever given, this is who I am. And very notable, her people were saying that they didn`t run it by the West Wing. I`ve never heard of that. I mean, normally, the East Wing, the First Lady`s office works with the President. And they`re kind of a unit. This time, this was her, and I do think it helps him but I think it helps Melania Trump. And if she -- if they do win again, I think people will look at her a little differently. You know, she usually speaks one or two minutes and hides sometimes we don`t see her for a month or two at a time. This was a big, big night for her. WILLIAMS: John Heilemann, I guess we`re just using the presidency and the White House now as a backdrop for a political convention. JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Yeah, I guess we are Brian, little different. And, you know, I`ve been listening and watching. And I obviously share the sort of shock and the chagrin of a lot of the guests who`ve been on since you took over at the end of this spectacle of, you know, now we`ve had two nights of kind of political self-pleasuring on the part of the president. And I chatted -- with Phil said, I think is important. And I want to get to the politics of this and the strategy here and what I find confounding about it just as a purely strategic matter, you know. They are using, as Phil said, the office of the presidency, the grandeur of the presidency, all of these official buildings and official processes, as you said, to build Donald Trump up, to make him bigger, to make him occupy apparently to make him be persuaded, to build a perception that he somehow occupies the job. The last nearly three, nearly four years of Donald Trump the problem, the political problem for the White House has not been that Donald Trump is too small a figure. The problem is that Donald Trump is too big, a figure already in some ways and too pervasive figure and what the public has rendered so far as a judgment on him. If you look at all of the data that we`ve seen, particularly since the start of COVID, is that there is an -- the President is behind the eight ball politically there. He is not a popular figure in America. He is he is trying to launch a comeback with this convention. And the key element of that was to try to make this election not about him, not a referendum on Donald Trump, but make it a choice between him and Joe Biden then seek to disqualify Joe Biden, although we have heard attacks on Joe Biden for the last two nights. What I think these last two nights are particularly tonight with all the Trump children and Melania Trump speaking, these two nights have been all about Donald Trump. They`ve kept the focus exclusively on him and enlarged him as a presence. I think that fights their interests. They should be -- they must try to make this about Joe Biden because if they make it about Donald Trump, that is what the campaign wants and I think there`s no one in politics right now who thinks that I referendum election on Donald Trump is an election he can win. So it beyond serving his narcissism, I don`t see how this is advancing their strategic interests, the kind of convention we`ve seen the last few nights and that it looks like we`re going to see for the next two nights. WILLIAMS: And Phil, indeed, to John`s point, now everyone uses the interregnum, these hours between now and tomorrow night session, to look and see what the President tosses out on social media that may reverse some of the perceived gains of tonight. Secondly, Phil, it`s been argued that this is -- a lot of this is aimed at a potentially shaky base and not looking to bring in and dependence at all. RUCKER: I think that`s right, to the President`s tweets by the way, we`ll see what he does tomorrow but it might be in violation of the ethos that his wife laid out in her speech tonight. But looking at the base here, you`re absolutely right. So many of the speeches we saw last night and that we saw again tonight, were aimed at bringing that base together, knitting back together the Trump coalition from 2016. Not necessarily looking to expand it, but trying to give all of those base voters a reason to get further energized about Donald Trump. You heard a lot of talk tonight, including a speech that was particularly graphic about abortion, for example. You heard a lot of talk about the economy. You`ve heard from the Catholic High School students, talking about wearing his Make America Great Again hat and his war with the media. You even heard from the President`s three adult children who have spoken so far Don Jr. on Monday night, Eric and Tiffany tonight, very unusual speeches. They did not talk about the president as their father or a man of compassion or sort of peel back the curtain on what growing up in the Trump household was like, but you heard them deliver basically MAGA talking points to give fiery political partisan speeches to rile up Trump`s base. And that`s an indication that the Trump campaign may not feel secure in their base right now and that they need to make an effort here to make sure that they`ve got all those voters with them before they go reaching out into the middle. WILLIAMS: Mary, one of the speakers tonight has in the past advocated going back to one household vote. I guess one person one vote is overrated. One of the speaker -- the speaker who was polled tonight was pulled from the program for saying out loud, throwing her weight behind an old anti-Semitic trope brought to you by QAnon. It seems to me they got Mike Pence to denounce QAnon over the past what, 72 hours. Is that impossible for this President to do who when asked about them said they seem to like me? JORDAN: You know, I think that the message every time one of these things comes up is, oh, it`s the media blowing that up, you know, are they canceling people for nothing? I think we were just talking about the base. A lot of tonight was about women. We`re hearing from their own campaign, how worried they are about the softening vote, particularly suburban white women. Trump won 52% of white women last time. It shocked people actually because he`s running against Hillary Clinton. But there`s all kinds of science and how soft that was. You saw the video about Kellyanne Conway and all the women that worked for him at the White House. And you saw Billy Graham`s granddaughter, it was -- his own daughter, Tiffany, and then of course, Melania. A lot of this was geared towards saying that he is good for women. And we`ll see because I know that the campaign is worried about the base. And so even though they`re focusing on the base and not kind of expanding out and trying to get some independence they have a lot to worry even about who voted for them the last time. WILLIAMS: John, Mary invoked HRC, Democrats prone to an eye roll regard her as the gift that keeps on giving your show play this clip of Hillary Clinton. We`ll play it for our audience, discuss it on the other side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They have a couple of scenarios that they`re looking toward. One is messing up absentee balloting so that they then get maybe a narrow advantage in the Electoral College on Election Day. Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and eventually I do believe he will win if we don`t give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So John Heilemann, what do you make of her very public advice and its timing? HEILEMANN: Well, I`m -- Brian, I make a bit, something that`s a perfect horshack for the American body politic right now. The reaction to this clip has been, you had on the right has seized on the clip, you`ve had -- from this morning, you had Sean Hannity, the President`s team put it up on his YouTube page, basically saying, you know, Hillary Clinton is advising Joe Biden to try to steal the election. There`s been an incredible amount of invective thrown her way as there always is when she says something controversial from the right. But on the left in the Democratic Party, they`ve all been saying damn right. She`s telling the truth right here and she`s given him very good advice. And I guess I would say, you know, Donald Trump has made it very clear over the last months that if -- that any result other than a clear cut victory for him, which is to say or at any result by which Joe Biden might win, he`s going to challenge. He`s going to say that the races are legitimate. He`s going to blame mail-in voting, he`s going to say the system was rigged, and he`s going to litigate like crazy. Hillary Clinton here seems to be essentially saying, this is what Donald Trump`s going to do, Joe Biden, you better get ready to do the same thing, that we`re going to be likely in an overtime situation, that this is going to be not a clear cut outcome on election night, and that you better lawyer up and get ready for the fight that might play out not just in one Florida situation like in 2000, but in multiple Florida, so to speak, from November all the way through potentially to January. And to me that that may be polarizing to partisans but that seems to me to be a pretty clear eyed assessment of where we`re headed. WILLIAMS: It being 17 minutes into Wednesday here in the East, special thanks, are in order for Phil Rucker, Mary Jordan, John Heilemann, greatly appreciate the three of you coming on with us. Coming up the days coronavirus headlines including something of a Mea culpa, walk back from our government official. Our special coverage of the Republican National Convention continues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) E. TRUMP: This is a fight that we are in right now. And it is a fight that only my father can win. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER: I personally could have been done better job and should have done a better job at that press conference explaining what the data is show regarding convalescent plasma. And I can assure the American people that this decision was made based upon sound science and data. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So that apology from the head of the FDA, Dr. Hahn, who now says he overstated the benefits of convalescent plasma as a coronavirus treatment. He was referring to the comments made during the President`s Sunday news conference announcing the emergency use authorization for the plasma or plasma as the President calls it despite lingering questions about the effectiveness of the treatment. So back with us again tonight Dr. Kavita Patel, clinical physician, former Senior Aide to Valerie Jarrett during the Obama years. She is now a nonresident fellow at Brookings and among our political contributors. So, Doc, after this f FDA correction, do you still fear because they`re involved as well, an unproven vaccine rushed to market for political reasons, it sure is possible? DR. KAVITA PATEL, FORMER AIDE TO VALERIE JARRETT IN THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE: Yeah, absolutely, Brian. And I think you said it`s really the political reasons that are the caution here. And by the way, this convalescent plasma is just one in a series of events, starting with hydroxychloroquine also getting one of those emergency use approvals, through claims and misstatements made by scientific advisors to the President about the virus testing treatment. So it`s no surprise, Brian, that people are very much calling to question legislators, doctors, scientists alike, and simply put, Dr. Hahn is a respected oncologist. And for him to make that kind of mistake. It just really it feels like -- it`s just Pandora`s Box and what can we do but to ask for scrutiny of the data. We must demand transparency and full view of the data around those phase three trials, the very important trials going on right now, for any vaccine that receives an emergency approval. WILLIAMS: Anti vaxxers are already a potent force in our society. Our own experts have pointed out how they`re getting an assist from the Russians on social media, if you add to their percentage of the population, doubts about the safety or effectiveness of a vaccine, we`ve got a real public health problem on top of a public health problem, correct? PATEL: Yeah, absolutely. And we know that vaccine hesitancy exists, anti vaxxers as well as people for different reasons who just do not want to get a vaccine. And Brian, what`s really tragic about this series of events culminating in that apology, from Hahn is that now you have people like myself who have been very clear that vaccines are safe and that I would personally take that vaccine, put a pause on that because we are doubtful of the credibility behind the very agency, which should be independent of politics. And that`s historical, Brian. That`s in Republican and Democratic administrations, which I`ve worked through. And I`ve never seen such level of political interference for the Food and Drug Administration. WILLIAMS: In the meantime, testing still is not where it needs to be. We all know people who for financial reasons or availability or convenience still can`t get tested despite wanting to explain this new CDC policy on testing having to do I think with people who have had exposure but are asymptomatic? PATEL: Yeah, it`s causing all of us to scratch our heads in the public health community. And we`re anxiously trying to understand what data went into it because this is the very same agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which cited the large number of people that are asymptomatic and are positive for the coronavirus. But in short, Brian, tonight like earlier today, they issued guidance that if you`ve been in contact with someone who is known to have COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes and closer than six feet, that you do not need a test unless you are vulnerable or a frontline worker of some type. And so -- and they don`t even recommend -- what`s really confusing is they don`t even recommend that you self-isolate or quarantine, they just say simply that you don`t need to get tested. And one can only conclude that this might be because we`ve got such a long turnaround time two to three days to get results back and that those are not as useful, but it certainly is a very different move for the agency and especially just one additional point as you see universities all around the country with hundreds of cases that each place their positive. Those are asymptomatic carriers and we know that they`re a source of transmission for the virus. WILLIAMS: Two to three days in some cases if you`re lucky, Dr. Kavita Patel, thank you, as always. And thanks tonight for staying up to talk with us. Coming up to political veterans from two political parties, James Carville, Mike Murphy when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BONDI: Democrats have been lecturing America about integrity for four years while their nominee has been writing the textbook on abuse of power for 40 years. If they want to make this election a choice between who`s saved in America and who`s swindled in America, bring it on. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) M. TRUMP: I have been moved by the way Americans have come together in such an unfamiliar and often frightening situation. It is in times like this that we will look back and tell our grandchildren the true kindness and compassion, strength and determination, we were able to restore the promise of our future. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Speaking from the Rose Garden, which she just redesigned, the First Lady tonight And that brings us to our next segment, talk to two political pros. So back again with us tonight, James Carville, a veteran democratic strategist who rose to national fame with the Clinton presidential effort, who is cohost of the 2020 politics ""War Room"" podcast. And Mike Murphy, Republican strategist, co-director of the Center for the political future at the University of Southern California. He`s got a podcast of his own. He is cohost of the ""Hacks on Top"" podcast. Gentlemen, good evening to you. Mike, for people like you who came up in politics in a world of rules and regulations governing your behavior laws like the Hatch Act, a lot of people like you look upon tonight as the low point, the use of the grantor and the backdrop of the U.S. presidency, the House that still has scorch marks from when the Brits tried to burn it down. Still has John Adams admonition on the fireplace hearth. How did you view what happened tonight? MIKE MURPHY, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Oh, I was sickened by it as an institutionalist. You know, this isn`t a South Baltimore alderman`s race here. It`s not a toy, it`s the presidency of the United States. And, you know, Donald Trump, the country knows now that he`s a cheater, he cheats on his wives. It looks like he`s been cheating on his taxes, and is now cheating the rules of an election where you have to respect the voters. So, for everything from Pompeo`s deal to the tin pot dictator routine of the Marines opening the door form, the whole thing that anybody who cares about the institution, I don`t care what sides you`re on RD (ph), it was it was a transgression. And it just shows you that in Trump`s mind, there are no rules, there is no respect for democracy and frankly no respect for the American voter. WILLIAMS: James, same question, and no one has to tell you when you were a campaign guy, your campaign guy, the White House staff, the West Wing staff, the East Wing staff for that matter, is walled off or is supposed to be, your reaction to using the United States presidency with no consequence in a political convention? JAMES CARVILLE, VETERAN DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, it`s good to be on with Mike Murphy (ph), haven`t seen him in a while. But, look, this whole thing and in the Clinton ministration, Obama administration to Bush administration, there was a wall between the foreign policy people and the political people. And that is just been sort of traditional the whole time. But I think what you saw from Pompeo tonight is just ongoing continuum, just breaking everything has been traditional about how the United States conduct foreign policy and how the United States current political campaigns. Remember, he tried to get the Ukrainians to do research on his political opponent. I mean, I don`t -- I`m not so appalled by what happened tonight because I just think so much has happened before that we shouldn`t really be surprised by this. WILLIAMS: But James, you not being surprised, isn`t that a living breathing example of the frog boiling experiment? We are living day in and day out in this country. I mean, another way to ask it is, who do we see about this? Who will right size the country and normalize us to the quaint days of say, four years ago? CARVILLE: A 160 million people may come out and vote this election, and they`re going to have to say so. And, you know, we were all outraged and people can, you know, don`t know what to think about this, but the voters are getting ready to weigh in. And I suspect they`re going to weigh in rather decisively here. But this is going to be an enormous turnout election and people are going to vote in -- they`re going to make a decision here, but we`ll see which way it goes, but I`m optimistic it will go a good way. WILLIAMS: Mike, do you agree with your friend from Louisiana? MURPHY: Yes. The biggest political party in America right now is the fire Donald Trump party. You know, the great thing about democracy is you can get a million of these horrible transgressions, but the voters have the biggest sledgehammer ever made and they can crack it down hard. I would tell my Democratic friends though, is you know, I`m a Republican voters against Trump, so, I`m renting not buying in Election Day be in for Biden. But careful about these process issues. As much as they make folks who work in the system and respect that like me and James furious, on the kitchen tables of America. It`s Trump`s screwed up COVID and he ruined the economy. And if you`ve ever liked have a job again and not be broke, you got to fire him. You know, let`s keep it on the real issues because I love Democrats some of the time but they tend to want to give the speeding tickets and the wait a minute you cheated on Page 11 of the regulations. I get it to the meat and potatoes economy in Trump incompetence to fire him and then you can clean up this big mess this guy has created against our institutions. WILLIAMS: And Mike, because, to take your point, do you think they hold anybody over tonight? Or do you just -- do you vote your own life and circumstance? CARVILLE: Tonight? Look, last night was the high point at Kimberly Guilfoyle or whatever, they don`t have a top down, but that they can go for years and not top that night. I mean, they`re going to have to bring QE on Wednesday night to stimulate interest like she did. The biggest complaint that I hear that people tell me to do focus groups and talk to voters is a lot of people actually thought Trump was going to do something on health care. And this is a dominant crushing issue. And if you watch that convention tonight you wouldn`t know that there`s a health care crisis or pandemic going on in this country. And Mike is right, you know, and even some of the never Trumpers have to get back to more earthy issues here, and that`s a criticism, I think, from both the Democratic side and the never Trump side that we can get too far into esoterica hit. And we got to realize if people really hurt, I mean, an ominous high. Health care cost is skyrocketing. In the countries in economic banks (ph) and social banks right now. And we`ve got to be careful to jerk this back in and focus on that coming down the stretch. I thought the Democratic Convention was pretty good until Biden -- I thought Biden was very good. I thought he had the most relevant speech of the entire convention, which I`m glad because it`s the one that counted the most. WILLIAMS: All right, gentlemen, don`t move an inch. Our questions continue, one, on the topic of tough love. In our next segment both gentlemen have agreed to stay with us. We`re back after this (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BONDI: When millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump, they knew he`d be different. And he is. He`s a tough, no nonsense outsider who can`t be bought or intimidated. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So, still with us are our guests Mike Murphy and James Carville. So Mike, you heard the lady from Florida. We heard the First Lady tonight say Donald Trump was an authentic person. Who`s this designed to work on? MURPHY: Well, every once in a while, these two knives they`ve taken kind of an awkward fling at humanizing Trump. You know, captain empathy, and it`s a hard sell. I thought Melania gave a good speech, but it had very little to do with her husband. At the end of it, I wanted to put her down as undecided on the reelection because, you know, she gives the kind of empathy speech that he can. And when Tiffany and Eric spoke, it was just the talking points of the Trump, you know, revolution, all Republican primary stuff, and not anything about any dimension to this guy. So I -- they`re bad at it and it doesn`t work and I don`t think people believe it. Trump`s brand is kind of strength and fighting and grievance. And so the softer side of Donald things, I think fall pretty flat. And it`s just striking to me that if anybody ought to be able to say something about him as a human being it ought to be as kids, but apparently the cupboard is bare. WILLIAMS: Hey, James -- CARVILLE: Yes? WILLIAMS: -- what brings us to the tough love portion of our broadcast, and that is some stuff the left may have to answer for. A video that was sent around all day. I`ve know you`ve seen it. Outdoor dining in the Adams Morgan section of Washington last night. They were demanding this woman who`s sitting there eating her dinner, raise her fist in solidarity with them to agree that white silence is violence. The woman happens to have marched with the Black Lives Matter because she says for weeks she felt coerced, attacked and harassed. This was a public spectacle. I saw a number of people passing this around on Twitter today with the tagline ""This is how Trump wins."" Because of what the right will do with imagery like this, say nothing thing of the fact that last night in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at one point there were 40 buildings with fires burning in them, and it`s not discussed all day long. And it`s often not discussed in prime time. But it`s the image of America that we have seen on trial this week. CARVILLE: This is a problem. And basically they`re not Democrats. I mean, who would do something like that? And you know, there are a lot of people who got a genuinely outraged for what happened, they should just criminality, no. And the, you know, this is a problem and it gets passed around. And we should not be sympathetic to people acting like that. They have no right to go in and intrude on that woman space like that. And I`m not going to defend that at all. It`s just -- it`s indefensible to do something like that. And get, in addition, to be in a health risk, getting in her face like that, good God. But what is wrong with people -- WILLIAMS: Mike, of course, it`s in tolerance by -- CARVILLE: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- it`s intolerance by any other name, Mike, and of violence summary in these cities feed into the plotline we`re seeing that you`re just not safe. MURPHY: Yes. Look, it is absolute high octane gasoline for a demagogue like Trump to work with. So if I were Biden, I`d start to put the race away by taking a tough line on this a little bit of Nixon to China. You know, they put out a statement, which was fine, but I`d like to see video of Biden saying protest, yes. Peaceful, yes. Changed the world, yes, elect me, but zero tolerance for this kind of intimidation, bullying and violence. He ought to get out there and drop that hammer and preempt Trump. You do himself a lot of good. CARVILLE: I think he will. I think he will. Because I think Biden is outraged -- WILLIAMS: If you knew any prominent Democrats I could pick up the phone and make that call. CARVILLE: Think a lot of mob (ph). And I don`t think Biden is not at all, at all like this. So I think he is all about as anybody in the United States, I really do. WILLIAMS: Well, this is still a moving object. James Carville, Mike Murphy, great to have you both. Thank you both for staying up with us tonight. We greatly appreciate it. Coming up for us, the religious right front and center tonight. Charlie Sykes, who let`s not forget is the man who wrote the book on ""How the Right Lost Its Mind,"" weighs in for us next. He`s standing by as our special coverage continues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBY JOHNSON, ACTIVIST: This election is a choice between two radical antilife activists and the most prolife president we have ever had. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH, FRANKLIN GRAHAM`S DAUGHTER: The Biden-Harris vision for America leaves no room for people of faith. Whether you`re a baker, a florist, or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar. Because the radical left God is government power. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: On the same day we heard from the granddaughter and daughter of the Reverend Billy and Franklin Graham, the scandal surrounding another of his high profile, evangelical supporters is intensifying all around Donald Trump. Jerry Falwell, Jr. officially resigned today as president of Liberty University. Reuters was first to report ""a business partner of Jerry Jr. has come forward to say he had a years long sexual relationship involving Falwell`s wife and the evangelical leader."" In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Falwell admitted his wife`s affair but denied any involvement in it himself. For more, we are joined by our old friend Charlie Sykes, Founder and Editor-At-Large of the Bulwark. And let`s not forget the author of ""How the Right Lost Its Mind,"" which a book that came out while people were still trying to figure out just what it is they were seeing. Hey, Charlie, how much of your party tonight seemed familiar to you? CHARLIE SYKES, THE BULWARK FOUNDER AND EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Well, it`s not my party anymore. But you know, when you`re talking about how the right lost its mind, this convention really does seem to codify the Republican Party`s abandonment of any ideas or policies or ideology, and it`s become really a cult of personality. And I think that was on display last night and certainly on display again tonight. WILLIAMS: We`re talking about the problems for Trump because of the problems that have blown up Mr. Falwell`s life. I want to play for you and remind our audience some of what Donald Trump has said about this individual. We`ll talk about it on the other side. (END VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Evangelicals like Donald Trump, they like Donald Trump. And you know, Jerry Falwell Jr, who`s an incredible guy from Liberty University, he endorsed me. Jerry Falwell, Jr. has had so much to do with my success with the evangelicals. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Charlie, where does this leave Donald Trump? SYKES: Well, by the way, he`s absolutely right about that. Jerry Falwell, Jr. was crucial in that remarkable shift of evangelicals behind Donald Trump. And their decision, that personal character didn`t matter that much anymore. So, where does that leave Donald Trump? Where does that leave evangelical Christianity which has made this Gaussian bargain with Donald Trump when they decided that the access to power was more important than the content of their fate? So, I -- you would like to think that people would be repelled by this, that this would have an effect, but no. Look, if you`ve gone so far as to support Donald Trump to be the president of the United States, the role model in chief, you`ve obviously also signaled that you`re prepared to sacrifice a lot of other values. And I think we`ll look back on this, though, and we`ll see this as is really kind of addictive of what`s happened to the Christian right. And how this this lust for power has corrupted both our politics and unfortunately our fate. WILLIAMS: How do you answer it when people ask you what happened to the party? We have no platform this year, just the one guy. How has this one guy been able to exert this personal hold over all these elected officials think about Republicans in the Senate, who have just signed over their seats, their voting records, all they are in hope to be, is it all out of fear that he might tweet about them? SYKES: You know, there is obviously a certain amount of fear and we`ve talked about this for the last four years, but it`s still remarkable, you know. And they`re afraid of him because of what`s happened to the party at a deeper level. Look, Donald Trump is transforming the Republican Party. There`s no question about it that that`s on display this week. But also the Republican Party`s dysfunction was a preexisting condition. Otherwise, you wouldn`t have had Donald Trump. And I think this has been coming for a lot longer than guys like me would like to admit. I think it does indicate how radicalized the party had become, how hollowed out it become, how vulnerable it would become to propaganda and to conspiracy theories. And I think that when we look back on all of this, well, we are looking back on all of this. I think we`re going to have to come to grips with how badly broken the party was even before Trump. Because you know, Brian, would Donald Trump leaves office, the Republican Party is just not going to snap back to sanity and normality. It`s not going to get rid of the crazies, it`s not going to be able to shed all of the things that it has exposed about itself over the last four years. WILLIAMS: What happens in the event of a Trump loss? Who gets to decide the design of what is formed from the ashes? And while it will be entertaining to watch, Republican elected officials saying, hey, that wasn`t me, I made my criticisms known privately. It`s also going to be sad knowing who was complicit this whole time. SYKES: Yes, I honestly don`t know. But I think that we got to be prepared for Trump and Trumpism to be a force and a factor in Republican politics for a long time. I don`t think he`s going anywhere. I don`t think his supporters are going anywhere. And I don`t want to leave on a really depressing note, but believe he loses. There`s nothing that blocked him from running again in four years. And if you think that that`s implausible, ask yourself what Republican would run against him in the primary and would be able to beat him in 2024. So, you know, look, my position on this, my feelings about this is basically look, the house is burning down right now. And let`s put out the fire. Let`s deal with the crisis and we`ll worry about the redecorating later. It`s very difficult to predict what`s going to happen and a lot depends on obviously whether Donald Trump loses, which is not a sure thing, and how badly he loses. Obviously, the Republican Party is going to react very differently to a landslide defeat, rather than to a very close defeat, which Donald Trump will of course insist was the result of fraud. WILLIAMS: I think that`s exactly the kind of thing our viewers need to hear. And Charlie Sykes, thank you for coming on. Thank you for saying it. Good to see you. And that`s going to do it for our broadcast tonight. Thank you for being here with us. Our special coverage of the Republican National Convention night two continues right after this quick break.
