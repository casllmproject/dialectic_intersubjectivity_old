115673,2020,7,2,fox,THE FIVE,"KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That is unverified intelligence that's currently being assessed. true UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first question, Monday the president went after stripping racist names on buildings. true JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany's briefing is underway. We will monitor it for you for any big news. But in the meantime, hello, everybody, I am Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Brian Kilmeade, Donna Brazile, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. true President Trump making some big news on wearing masks as cases of Coronavirus surge in the United States, America reporting 44,000 new infections yesterday, and at least 16 states now pausing, reversing, or delaying reopening plans. President Trump weighing in on wearing masks in an interview with Fox Business. Take a look. true (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) true DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't know if you need mandatory. Many places in the country people stay very long distance. You talked about social distancing. But I'm all pro-masks. I think masks are good. If I were in a group of people and I was close. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one. TRUMP: I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people and we are not 10 feet away. Usually, I'm not in that position. And everyone is tested because I'm the president. They get tested before they see me. But if I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public would see that? TRUMP: I have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I said I like the way I look. I thought it was OK. It was a dark, black mask. And I thought it looked OK. I looked like the Lone Ranger. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: The Lone Ranger. Yesterday, I felt like the Lone Ranger. I was all by myself. I couldn't talk to anybody. I'm sorry. I didn't make the show. I missed guys you so much, some more than others. I'm glad we are back here. It was an act of God. Let's just put it that way. All right, Dana Perino, I think it is good policy that the president is pro-masks. I think he's always been pro-mask, but maybe didn't say it the right way. It is good policy and good politics. People are prone masks. I have mine. I kind of look like the Lone Ranger. It's black. I wear it when I go inside. What do you think? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: First of all, I want to say that must've been the worst thing for you, which was to sit here and listen to all of this commentary yesterday but you couldn't say anything. It might've been like how your mom and dad would've liked you to spend your teenage years. WATTERS: Donna was talking trash. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I missed you guys. PERINO: I felt like what the president said today on masks, is where he should have been for a while now. But he got there so now he's there. The Vice President Mike Pence, and I believe the First Lady -- she did a tweet at one point where she said people should wear masks. It's also where the public wants him to be. So I like that that's where he ended up. And also, when he has a little bit of levity, a little bit of a light moment, and he is like, I looked good. I looked like the Lone Ranger. That kind of thing really penetrates. And it shows some of that -- not a politician type of thing. Americans like their president to have a sense of humor and he was able to do that. A sense of humor about something very serious, Mitch McConnell on the Daily Briefing today said something interesting. The Senate has been working for the last two months. They have a policy. They wear masks. No one has come down with Coronavirus in the Senate that we know of, no additional senators. The House on the other hand has not been there for -- only eight days in the past several months. And you can see that if you go to work, if you want to go to work and you're wearing a mask, you can do so safely. And I think the president needs to continue to push this because we need the economy to get back up and running. The other thing is America's businesses need the president's backup. You have young kids that are working in restaurants trying to enforce a mask policy. The governors have imposed or mayors have imposed. And they are supposed to be up against customers who don't want to wear a mask. It's unfair. Now, if the president is saying I encourage everyone to wear masks. I think it gives them a little bit of backup. WATTERS: Yeah. It really goes a long way. And I think he tried, as you say, to be a little bit light-hearted. Katie Pavlich, do you know who the Lone Ranger is? KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: I know the name. PERINO: She's from Arizona. (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: I know the name. But I wasn't a big TV watcher or a movie watcher growing up so I'm not a big -- I don't have any lines or anything to repeat to you, Jesse, but I'm sure you can teach me some time. WATTERS: So what do you think about Dana's point about a little levity with the masks and good public policy. You don't want to be anti-mask as people are getting more nervous as cases sprout up in the south and a little bit in the west. PAVLICH: It seems like there would've been a really great marketing opportunity for the Trump campaign to print out hundreds of thousands of face coverings that said Trump 2020 on them or MAGA or whatever else they wanted to market. Similar to the hats they marketed in 2016 which were so successful. It's something they could've done early on. But in terms of, you know, the customers who don't want to wear masks, you know, there's a question about whether the federal government should mandate masks. Businesses have requirements about whether or not you can be served inside of their businesses if you don't have one on. The bottom line is the federal government blew this from the beginning when the surgeon general came out on Twitter and screamed at the American people that they should not wear a mask because they don't work with a number of exclamation marks. And then came out later and acted as if nothing happened. So, you know, regardless of whether you should or should not wear one, I've been wearing face masks on years in planes and public transportation to avoid getting sick. The government screamed at them, didn't help protect them. They are now mandating and threatening a fine or prison time. It's something people have a hard time accepting that they are mandatory that they work all of a sudden. WATTERS: Donna Brazile, so Katie mentioned it was the whole task force, Fauci himself said, you know, we kind of lied to the American people about masks in the beginning because we didn't want the American people to hoard the masks, because people in the hospitals and the frontlines desperately needed them. There has been mixed messaging on masks. It seems like everybody's getting on the same page now. DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS HOST: And Jesse, by the way. I missed you yesterday. I came dressed just for the occasion and you didn't show up. It was a party without the music. But I'm glad you're here today. I can now listen to you. I agree that if we can save lives, reopen up our economy, get the American people back on their feet, and do it the right way. Everybody's going to come out ahead. And I want to quote the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. She said masks are great again. Yes, God bless. I have every color in the rainbow. And if anyone needs any additional masks, call me. I know how to make them now. WATTERS: OK, Donna, quoting the chairman of the Republican National Committee. I don't know if that's ever going to happen again. Brian Kilmeade, do you think maybe in the beginning with the mask thing, maybe the White House didn't want to go all in on masks, just psychologically because it's a scary thing for some people. Maybe they wanted people to forget about the virus or move past the virus. And they thought maybe it undermined confidence in the recovery. Do you think that was a part of it? BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: Jesse, that's a great point. You can't show panic in time of war. After 9/11, things like that. The guy on top or the woman on top is panicking. That's a bad ripple effect. But I would just say this. Even though we are in the middle of all those conferences and all those briefings and people were talking about the president said this and what about that. And man, he's going to have trouble getting over this. That's all in the rear view mirror. Think about what we have already been through. It's June turning into July. From here on in, the president showed today when he talked to Fox News -- Fox Business, he wants to win. He's not comfortable wearing a mask. I don't know too many people outside Katie who's been wearing them for a while that's comfortable wearing a mask in everyday life. But the president says you're not going to knock me out easy. You're not going to make things hard for my prefers (ph). I'm wearing it. You will see with it. Number two, he has to go to these regions and find out what's going on. It's not his fault about the virus, so go out to Washington. They have a consortium of states. Go to California. Meet with Newsome face-to-face. Go to the northeast with Connecticut and Massachusetts and New Jersey as well as New York and say what are you doing on the ground? And just show that you care, especially to seniors. Seniors are dying. And seniors are his base, 65 and up. And he's suffering in that area. And I know he cares about them. Obviously, he cares about them. That's his age bracket. So go and find a way to show you care and don't wait for the big rally whether it is streamed or live in person. And I think he could really be on the offensive, all the other things he could be doing. And I think from here on in, I think you'll see him on the offensive. WATTERS: I do, too. And I agree. It's a good idea to get out of the White House and see the country. Maybe he could go visit the newly liberated CHOP out in Seattle. All right, coming up, Joe Biden went after President Trump pretty hard yesterday, and now the president is counterpunching in a big way. That's next on The Five. PAVLICH: President Trump responding after Joe Biden attacked him yesterday. And the former VP emerging from his bunker to criticize the president over the Coronavirus and now Trump is hitting back. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: They say this. If he got elected, it's an overhang over the market because the market would crash. He doesn't know where he is frankly. I watched his press conference yesterday. He's answering questions like this from a teleprompter. I said, what's that all about? But his people, the people around him are radical left. They're going to raise taxes. They're going to raise regulations. And they're going to put everyone out of business. It would be a disaster. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: So Jesse, when the president refers to the people around President Trump pushing him to the left and their policies. It's a pretty important point when it comes to what Joe Biden is embracing in terms of the economy of AOC and others like her. WATTERS: Yeah, a sleepy corrupt puppet. That's how they are going to brand the guy. So I watched his press conference yesterday, Katie. And it was like when you see an endangered species in the wild. You are like, kids, gather around, don't make any noise. There is a Biden sighting. Look, I mean, it was astonishing to see the guy out there, it was great. And he goes after the president says, you know, I've been telling the president how to beat COVID-19. He's just not listening to me. And then you listen to his plan. It is everything Trump is doing. But Joe Biden is going to do it faster and better. And then the rest of it is Trump is never going do rejoin the WHO. But the questions he was getting, I mean, softball city. And Biden's still hitting singles or just striking out. My favorite question was, are you nervous that you are winning so early and easily right now, Mr. Biden? And I also learned that he's for Jefferson, against Robert E. Lee, and he is wishy-washy on Wilson. So that was good, but the main headline I saw from yesterday, Katie, is number one, Joe Biden is not going to hold any rallies, he said. Number two, he said that he hasn't been tested for COVID-19. And number three, that he's constantly being tested for cognitive decline. And that's the reason you don't put Joe Biden out there, because he just admitted that he's being constantly tested to see if his mental faculties are in decline. So that opens up a whole lot of questions. Which doctor did the tests? Can we see the results? How often have they been? I mean, those are the things that maybe I would expect someone to ask him a month from now when he does his next press conference. PAVLICH: I think we need a Watters World from the streets of the Joe Biden press conference next time the endangered species emerges from the bunker. But Dana, is that a strategy, though, that less is more? It is something you pay attention to when Joe Biden does come out in public and hold a so- called press conference and it seems to be working for them to this point. PERINO: Yeah, definitely. I think it's been super frustrating. The Trump campaign wants to punch back, which they did today. And what you saw yesterday was something that was a little bit more traditional in any campaign. You have the opponent comes out, gives a big speech, takes a few questions. And then the White House responded yesterday with a briefing that they added after the speech, 3:30 yesterday. The president does the interview today. I thought it was different today. The president got to the two issues that he is really very strong in the polls and that is the economy. Basically saying I know some of you may not like me, but if you get this other guy as president, then your taxes are going to go up. The economy is going to suffer. And right now, when people are asked what your main issue of concern is, they say Coronavirus and racial strife. But come November, when everybody focuses on hopefully we are back to a place where Coronavirus is less of a threat, then you have people thinking about the economy again, and that might be his edge. So trying to define Biden that way is a lot more useful for them then saying Sleep Joe all the time because that obviously wasn't working. PAVLICH: Yes. So Donna, economics are very personal. And enthusiasm is something that is coupled with your own personal economic situation. As you know, the polling shows that President Trump has a lot more enthusiasm in terms of voters wanting to come out and vote for him in November at this point than Joe Biden. Is that going to be a problem for him? BRAZILE: You know, Joe Biden received a lot of endorsements over the last 24 hours. He rattled Donald Trump out of his bunker, got him to speak up today. Admit he needs to set an example by wearing a mask. And here's some other great news. Joe Biden today learned that some of the Bush alumni will be forming a super pac to help him out. He also understands that he has to go out there and raise money and continue to rattle the president. But one other piece of good news -- and for the vice president, and I'm talking about Joe Biden, is that the Trump campaign seems to be in somewhat of disarray. Not only do they lack a coherent message. There is a massive shake-up going on in the campaign. So the president is not even satisfied with his own team. So before you try to hurl any insults at Joe Biden for holding a press conference, perhaps it's time for the Trump team to figure out if they have the right players on the field. PAVLICH: But Brian, do endorsements turn into votes that someone like Joe Biden needs in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania? I mean, Hillary Clinton had a lot of endorsements but not as much enthusiasm either. KILMEADE: And, you know, Donna brings up a good point about the Bush people. A few dozen people unhappy with President Trump, and they believe Joe Biden will be a moderate. Joe Biden may have been a moderate, but that's a long time ago. When AOC is one of your advisors and Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker with more power maybe than him, if he does in fact, get this. And James Clyburn will have the most power in the country because he's single-handedly delivered that nomination to Joe Biden. He's not going to be a moderate. And number -- and number two, I think it's really important. President Trump has got to be disciplined. He's got to have a clear message like Donna said. And if he does, that will help him twofold. It will increase his ratings, but it'll close the gap. And it'll force Joe Biden out of the basement, because with this lead, he has no reason to leave. If this lead disappears, Biden's got to come out. You don't need to run an ad document is cognitive degradation. You will see him doing three or four events a day and you will see the decline. If not, more power to him. But by the time they get to the debates, by the time they get to the debates. In 2016, the Billy Bush tape aside until Election Day, if he shows that discipline come, if he shows that discipline, that gap closes rapidly. He has the advantage. He's got the ball. He's got the presidency. He can govern. If he goes ahead and governs like a president and shows people what he's capable of, he's going to win. If not, Biden deserves the victory. PAVLICH: There's a long way to go. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: He's not listening to Brian. KILMEADE: He was today. BRAZILE: All right, boo. We'll see. PAVLICH: All right. Coming up, Seattle finally shuts down its cop free zone as the left continues their nationwide effort to de-fund the police. KILMEADE: After four shootings, two deaths, and a surge in violent crime in 23 days of total lawlessness, the city of Seattle shutting down its cop free zone, police this morning clearing out the remaining anarchists from the neighborhood they had hostage for weeks. Here are some of the highlights from what the mayor called CHOP's summer of love. KILMEADE: In New York, police clashing with protesters just hours after the city council slashed $1 billion from the NYPD's budget. We have in New York City, I say we. I don't take ownership of our mayor is enthusiastically endorsing our own occupy movement, which I sense might in fact end exactly like Seattle's. Katie, Seattle, 5:00 a.m., the mayor summer of love says a moving in getting them out. What changed in two weeks? PAVLICH: What changed is these violent protesters decided to go to her house and start making noise outside of where she lives. So when it happens with a number of these elitist politicians who think that all the rules that they put out there or the irresponsible behavior they allowed to go on inside their cities, the one doesn't affect them, they are fine with allowing it to affect everyone else in the city. But when it comes to their front door, that's when they start to react. She didn't really like that. It's the same hypocrisy that we saw in Minneapolis with the city council de-funding the police, using taxpayer money to pay for private security. You know, Bill De Blasio is slashing this billion dollars in the NYPD budget. So that people in regular neighborhoods have less police protection. But he's not willing to give up his own police protection. So it's funny how when this comes to the doorstep of these politicians they are willing to act on it after people have been murdered inside their cities. And the question now is whether the business owners in Seattle or the people who want to work at those businesses will be reimbursed for all the damages that this mayor who supported this violent movement from the very beginning endorsed and is responsible for because she refused to stop it in the name of democracy. KILMEADE: The troublemakers, as a Seattle city councilmember (Inaudible). Donna, I wanted to have a legitimate racial equity conversation after George Floyd's death. When I saw African-Americans being interviewed Monday morning getting ready Fox and Friends, saying I don't know what's happening here. I was involved in this, but this is taking us over. And I see all these other kids, these other white kids yelling at black cops, telling them what's wrong with white society. I can't get my head around what's happening here. Are you worried about a legitimate conversation going awry? BRAZILE: Well, absolutely. I'm always worried when the narrative shift from the intended purpose, which is to talk about racial equity, to talk about justice and policing act, to talk about banning chokeholds. I'm always worried when there are a few instigators, whether they're on the right or the left, who infiltrate these peaceful protesters and make it about them and not about the issues at hand. And I'm also worried when we don't have public officials working with community leaders to discuss these issues in a non-violent and non-confrontation way. I would hope that after these last couple of weeks, we can still sit down and have this conversation because you know what, Brian, this is going to happen again. If we don't fix the underlying problems, it's going to keep happening. And let me just say this as a Democrat, and I don't speak for Democrats, I don't speak for lefties, I don't speak for anybody. I'm going to speak for myself. I don't want to get rid of the police departments. I want policemen and policewomen to do their jobs, which is to protect the citizens of their community. I don't want them to lose their ability to protect the community. But I also want policemen not to be referees in family disputes, not to be you know, people who have to go and get homeless people off the bench. So let's have a decent conversation, not a finger-pointing conversation. And I guarantee you I can come to some results. KILMEADE: You're not going to have a good conversation with the shirtless, sweaty skateboarder who doesn't even know why they're -- don't know why they're protesting. Dana -- BRAZILE: I don't even know skateboarders. KILMEADE: Well, they're all out there in the streets. Dana, now in New York, the whole Occupy Movements got hundreds of people. They were mocking the NYPD yesterday while $1 billion is getting caught -- is being cut and I'm watching the NYPD just turn around and take it. Are you concerned that Seattle is going to -- New York 10 and like Seattle? PERINO: What's interesting is that the mayor of Seattle is giving the mayor of New York City a run for his money as worst mayor in America, and that is saying something. When you have police officers in New York City who are being treated so poorly and not having the backup of their elected leader, the mayor, I see a recipe for disaster, Brian. And you know, we dealt with Occupy Wall Street. That lasted for months. I don't think we have months here to deal with this. I think we have days to deal with it. KILMEADE: Well, guess what, Jesse, I'll go through a little bit of a curveball. It's not just Los Angeles and Seattle -- it's not just New York and Seattle, it's Los Angeles. The city council members said they started their first step program; they're going to begin to send out social workers to disputes that don't revolve around violence. So someone should tell a cop that there are violent disputes and non- violent disputes because oftentimes one blends into the other. Game on in L.A. WATTERS: Yes. I mean, how many times have you watched Live P.D. and it's like a non-violent situation and then all hell breaks loose. You're going to be pretty lucky if there's an armed officer there to intervene. And like you said, you have Seattle, you have Minneapolis, they've just abolish the police department. This is supposed to be a fringe thing to fund the police. Nancy says it's just on the fringes. We don't believe that. But you have multiple cities slashing $1 billion, $150 million, abolishing the whole thing. So it's -- if the democrats want crime to rise, then you do find the police because that's what happens when you defend the police. KILMEADE: It blows me away that that one person asked Joe Biden where do you stand on Seattle, not on defunding police. How do you feel about $1 billion being cut out of the NYPD? Are you comfortable sending social workers out to -- out where cops used to go and it didn't come up? Hopefully, it will in the future. BRAZILE: I hope so too. I hope so too. KILMEADE: Thanks to all of you for participating. I'm going to ask you to stick around for 26 more minutes. Ahead, President Trump blast the media over reports about Russian bounties on American troops. We'll switch our way out of this. PERINO: President Trump unleashing on the media over reports the Russians paid bounties for killing American troops. The president is saying it is a fake news hoax that is meant to damage him politically. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear pretty good, the intelligence people didn't even -- many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right, Brian Kilmeade, what's your take on that? KILMEADE: Well, I think to blow it out of proportion the way they have as if we didn't know that the Iranians, the Taliban, were trying to kill Americans for free because it's their life mission for 19 years. That's the story. If it was happening in Canada, that's a story. But in Afghanistan, our guys being targeted, that's called Tuesday. And for the Russians to be behind it, OK, worth pursuing. But to say this, I talk to two people that were in that meeting and they say that there was -- there was a dissent to that in the President's brief, which is why it didn't enter to the verbal part of the briefing. Dana, you used to tell me how President Bush want to get briefed every day but a lot of it was verbal. President Obama famously wanted to read it all himself, and then get maybe the highlights on the verbal briefing. This president likes a little bit different. But if you just go down and see what the President's doing to Russia and the favors he got back, the favors he got back, zero. What has he done? Crackdown on the natural gas movement into natural gas as it goes into Europe, of course, the treaties that he's left. And the Obama -- and the Obama administration, what do they do when they first walked in? Without asking they took out the missile shield in Eastern Europe and said, can we be friends? Vladimir Putin said, I don't think so. PERINO: OK, but Katie, why not just say, we're looking into it, there's dissent in the Intel Community, and I want to get more information, and the Gang of Eight is going to be brief tomorrow. Instead, almost egging on the -- whoever the leaker is to do more of it. PAVLICH: Well, it seems like that was what White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was trying to do today from the podium at the beginning of her briefing saying yes, the Gang of Eight will be briefed. The intelligence is still disputed. I think the President is just as frustrated because the implication from the punditry and the press is that he knew about this and therefore did not do anything about it because he is somehow in bed with the Russian government, which plays into this narrative that he's been facing for three years through the Mueller investigation and through other leaks in the Intelligence Community. Now, does that not mean that we should as a country be very concerned about what Russia is doing in Afghanistan and the links and connections that have been there for a long time with the funding that Russia has been giving to the Taliban and maybe what it was used for? Of course. But I think the frustration from the administration comes from this implication that President Trump knew about it and purposely didn't do anything because he has some somehow tied down to the Russian government. PERINO: Donna, politicizing intelligence, it's not new but it is disgusting. It's important, I think, even for somebody, especially for Vice President Biden who lived with intelligence briefings for eight years during the Obama administration to be exceptionally cautious at this point until we know more. But that's not the direction they decided to take. Why? BRAZILE: You know, I do believe in a situation like this. It's been five days, and we've had five different explanations. Everything from the intel brief didn't spell it out, and big, bold black letters with a marker. And of course, we've also heard that it was -- it was not part of the oral briefing, but it was in the written word. We've had so many excuses, so much finger point, and then, of course, we got to bring up Barack Obama and Joe Biden and George W. Bush and what they did. The President just needs to reassure the American people and the family members of our troops, our veterans, the people who are sacrificing for us that he is looking into the situation, but he has their back, period. Just tell us that you going to look into the situation, you're going to make sure that you have verifiable information. And if this is true, whether it's the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or the Russians, you're not -- this is unacceptable, and you're going to deal with it. That's all you have to do. And then let's get on to the next battle. PERINO: Yes. And Jesse, one of the reasons that politicizing intelligence is so dangerous is that it puts a president, a commander in chief into a position of having to deal with something publicly that may have been dealing with privately in a different way, and there might be people in harm's way. You know, we don't know all the answers to this. The Gang of Eight is going to be brief tomorrow. But I'm kind of hoping there's not additional leaks out of that. I'll give you the final word. WATTERS: Permission to make a sports analogy, Dana. PERINO: Sure. WATTERS: So, the Democrats run an offense and they run the same play every single time. It's an out and up, and everybody just bites on the pump fake and gets burned deep every single time. Are we seriously talking about an anonymous leak from the Intelligence Community to the New York Times that makes Trump looks like he's in bed with Vladimir Putin? Are we seriously going to do this all over again? Like they even use the same three reporters that they used on the Russia collusion hoax at the New York Times. And like, don't get me started, what about WMDs in Iraq? Do you remember the intelligence from that? They used one guy, the source. Remember what his name was, Curveball, aptly named curveball. He actually lied to us and said that Saddam had WMDs. And then when he didn't, he said, oh, you know what, I made that up because I wanted you to topple Saddam. So listen, I don't know if it's accurate intelligence. I'm open-minded. We don't know. And I do know this, the people that benefit from this leak, the Democrats politically, The New York Times financially, Russia geopolitically because they want us tied down in Afghanistan, and so do the defense contractors and the hawks. So just keep an open mind about when you hear about an intelligence leak that you read in the New York Times that makes Trump look bad. BRAZILE: It's about our troops, Jesse. PERINO: All right, pump fake. BRAZILE: It's about our troops. It's not about Democrats. PERINO: Pump fake, you're going to have to explain that one for me. WATTERS: Don't bite on the fake. PERINO: All right, we got to get going. BRAZILE: Russia attacks us. I know for sure. PERINO: Pump fake -- this is not a pump fake. We are teasing. Coming up, 2020 feels like the longest year ever, but it's only halfway over. What THE FIVE thinks lies ahead next. BRAZILE: I think we can all agree that it's been a heck of a year, but we're officially at the midway point. So, what's coming up next? I don't know. So, I will ask my colleagues on THE FIVE. Hey, Dana. I am really worried these days. PERINO: I think -- BRAZILE: I mean, what about UFOs? I mean, we're going to learn that we've been living with UFOs. I know Jesse has been living with them, but are we all going to figure it out now? Jesse, you know I love you so much. I have to say that part. PERINO: There are no UFOs. It doesn't exist. They don't exist, number one. Number two, I think SEC football is definitely going to come back. Number three, I the NFL is not going to come back. Number four, I think that we will get a vaccine before the end of the year. BRAZILE: Brian, so many unknowns. Your book is now out in paperback, Sugar, so what else -- what else is coming up? KILMEADE: Well, that was known. That was -- that was predicted by Nostradamus years ago. The biggest story, of course, of the year is Harry and Meghan left royalty. And for them to leave the Royal Family, everything else pales in comparison. But here's my prediction. My sense beginning with baseball, is we're going to watch baseball take off, we're going to watch basketball take root, we're going to watch fans begin to come to the games. We're going to get a sense of economic revival come the fall. Between the debates and this slow comeback story, we're going to feel better about ourselves. We're going to get our jobs back; we're going to get our sports back. By the time November comes back, we're going to be all relieved and say wow, wasn't that a -- wasn't that a bad beginning to 2020 but what a close. And sports, little by little, will help bring us the rest of the way. BRAZILE: And I know this is a great segue into terms of sports. To Jesse, Jesse, I'll throw the ball to you. There you go. What's coming back, baby? Touchdown. WATTERS: You know how Gutfeld lost 40 pounds? I predict we're going to find out there was a tummy tuck. Because there's no way a man that small in stature can lose 40 pounds naturally. Like, was there liposuction? I mean, it's not just from stopping the ribs or as little bike that he rides. It's like there's something going on there. He's either going to put it back or we're going to find out he did something surgically because I'm jealous and I'm not happy about it. KILMEADE: Put Steve Harrigan on that story. PERINO: It's terrible. It's terrible. BRAZILE: Katie, we celebrated that that new space mission, the commercial space flight. PAVLICH: Yes. BRAZILE: I mean, bring it home. Bring it home. What else can we expect for the rest of the year? PAVLICH: It's been a big year for space. I actually think that we're going to discover aliens and they're going to be very nice to us. They won't be the ones that are portrayed in the movies that just want to eat our organs and invade the earth. I think they'll be nice and teach us a lot of things about how to treat each other. You saw yesterday, SpaceX launched the first mission for the U.S. Space Force which is really exciting. So, I think keeping your eye on space is -- while the crazy things are happening here on Earth, would be hopeful and good for all of us. BRAZILE: You know, I think joy is coming back. I believe that we've been enduring for a nights, as the Bible say, but joy is coming in the morning. And next up, we got ""ONE MORE THING"" for you. WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" So, 4th of July right around the corner. It's on Saturday. What better way to show your pride in the United States? There was some Fox News gear. Look what we got here. We got a Proud American t-shirt. Look at that. Pete Hegseth has worked out in all of the t-shirts for sale, so basically like vintage stuff. You have a Proud American Hat like that. I mean even I would wear that. That's quality. You could get your proud American mug and drink some coffee and go to shop.foxnews.com and get 15 percent off with the code Fox Fourth. Do it. Dana Perino, you're up. PERINO: Jesse, can I just say that your hair is getting really long in the back? BRAZILE: I noticed it. I did too. WATTERS: It's borderline -- KILMEADE: Is that your ""ONE MORE THING?"" BRAZILE: He needs a haircut. PERINO: No. I just had a point of personal privilege there. OK, so there is a criminal genius in the U.K. and it has been caught red pawed. So Kara Probin, she's been baking her way through Coronavirus, and she's like, why are all of my baked goods leaving. Well, she set up a camera and here she is River. She's figuring out how to get her baked goods, so she's busted. But a pretty smart dog though figuring it out like get that cupcake. Hopefully, they can be dog-friendly, cupcakes. WATTERS: All right, Brian Kilmeade. KILMEADE: Jesse, I got a brand new series. It's true. The rumors are correct. Nothing to do with Pete Hegseth, but it is his favorite network. Fox Nation, What Made America Great has four new features rolling out. The woman's right to vote, believe it or not, it's been about 101 years since they earned the right to vote. It's embarrassing for our country but I'm glad we got -- we gave it to them and they earned it. What they went through is amazing. The Texas patriots Sam Houston and Sam Houston's final days, and the secrets to the White House which is going to be an extended version what you saw on Sunday. Here's a look at Jane Hampton Cook who did a book on this very topic, a good buddy of Dana's, worked in the Bush White House, great historian, and she talked about women's suffrage and the prison in which they stayed in order to get the right to vote. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: It's amazing because it started as meetings, it started as congregations. Let's talk about planning. Let's try to get that 19th amendment passed. What's it going to take. Let's get the right politicians. Let's bake them cakes. Let's send them nice notes and send their wives flowers. And it gets so bad, they end up in prison. 72 you said? JANE HAMPTON COOK, AUTHOR: 72 women came to this president. KILMEADE: I hope everyone likes it. Just go to Fox Nation and hope you like something great about America on America's birthday. WATTERS: All right. I like it. Donna Brazil? BRAZILE: Hey, I just came back from our first road trip, and Zahra and I are about to embark on a second one. We're going up to Massachusetts. I just want to let you know that she is a great, a great traveling companion. And thank you Dana and Hamdah for those wonderful treats. She loved them. I put them in the bag and we're on our way out. So Happy 4th, everybody. PERINO: Good. WATTERS: Happy 4th. All right, Katie, take us home. PAVLICH: Oh, all right. It's the 100th birthday of U.S. Coast Guard Veteran Andy Washington. Take a look at his celebration. He was put on a throne outside of his New Orleans home and we had a number of U.S. Coast Guard officials celebrating him. He served in the Coast Guard from 1942 to 1946. Happy birthday to him. PERINO: Awesome. WATTERS: Don't forget -- don't forget about the Coast Guard. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Happy birthday.

115074,2020,9,8,fox,YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO,"CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump just wrapping up his speech in the battleground state of Florida, where he just extended a ban on oil drilling off the Florida coast, this as the race continues to tighten, the president and Joe Biden now tied at 48 percent apiece in Florida among likely voters in a new NBC/Marist poll. true We are also watching Wall Street, the Dow taking a hit, as the battle over stimulus drags on, diving over 600 points a day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq also getting hit very hard, more than 4 percent, the fourth -- the third straight session in a row, plunging 4 percent, now in correction territory. true We have got a lot more and markets coming up. true Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. Phil Keating is in Jupiter, Florida, with more on the president's message to voters -- Phil. PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Charles. President Trump's motorcade should be pulling into the West Palm Beach International Airport just about right now. He spoke at the historic Jupiter Lighthouse for about 25 minutes today, claiming the torch of environmentalism. Air Force One, sometime this hour, we expect, will then fly to North Carolina for a campaign event in Winston-Salem. The White House is touting its budget proposal on environmental protection and conservation, specifically a $250 million infrastructure construction plan to fund on an annual basis the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. Over the past several years, there have been debilitating and marine-life killing algae blooms on the St. Johns River, as well as in Fort Myers on the Caloosahatchee River, each one triggered directly from massive water releases from Lake Okeechobee and all of the agricultural fertilizers that end up being flushed out to both sides of the state. And the president today actually made some news here regarding offshore drilling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In a few moments, I will sign a presidential order extending the moratorium on offshore drilling on Florida's Gulf Coast and expanding it to Florida's Atlantic Coast, as well as the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) KEATING: Also today, the Department of Interior is touting its record on eliminating species from the Endangered Species Act, saying, since 2017, 11 species, including the Hawaiian goose and the manatee, have been removed from that list. However, of course, Democratic lawmakers on the state and local level here in Florida today welcomed the president with a scathing press release, saying, his environmental record is disastrous, and he's being disingenuous for claiming it isn't -- back to you, Charles. PAYNE: Phil, thank you very much. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign, well, they have been hitting the president hard as well over his coronavirus response. Joe Biden and the president will both be campaigning in Michigan this week. Jacqui Heinrich is in Wilmington, Delaware, with more -- Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Afternoon, Charles. Well, today, there are no in-person events, but the Biden campaign is still responding to President Trump out in Florida today, telling Floridians ahead of the president's event not to expect a plan from President Trump on how to overcome the virus or put Floridians back to work. Biden wrote: ""With more than 11,000 deaths, 600,000 cases, and 3.6 million workers across the state who have filed for unemployment benefits since March, it is clear that Floridians have been hurt by President Trump's inability to contain the spread of COVID-19."" Upcoming travel signals a pretty major shift in campaign strategy post- Labor Day. Yesterday, Biden and Harris split up to tackle two swing states, and they're back in the air tomorrow. Biden will be heading to battleground Michigan. Thursday, Harris is heading to Florida. Former President Barack Obama is also getting more involved, tweeting this conversation with Senator Harris today: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I work out every morning, regardless of how much sleep I have had. It's just the best way to start the day. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: The Biden campaign also put out two new ads today as part of this week's $47 million ad blitz across nine battleground states. Biden's big spending comes amid reports that the Trump campaign is hitting a cash crunch, President Trump today saying that he will spend his own money if he has to -- Charles. PAYNE: Jacqui, thank you very much. With just 56 days ago to the election, the battle for these battleground states is now in high gear. So, how are things shaking out in states like Florida, where the race is now a tossup? With me now, RealClearPolitics' Susan Crabtree. Susan, 48-48. The polls, I'm not always interested in the numbers, but the direction, I think, is something that informs us. And it does feel like right now President Trump has that momentum going for him. SUSAN CRABTREE, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, yes, Joe Biden still has a sizable lead in the RealClearPolitics average nationally. But in the battlegrounds, that's where it really matters, and the race is significantly tightening in all eight battleground states. We see it within the margin of error, all under five points, in all eight states. And if you -- it's interesting, if you look at what the Biden campaign is saying, that they want to -- where they're targeting Georgia and Arizona and Texas. That's what they're saying, but what are they doing? They're going to -- they're traveling to Minnesota, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. These are the key battlegrounds. And, as you saw today, with the NBC/Marist poll, like you mentioned, Charles, 48 to 48 percent, a dead heat in Florida. And that's why we see both President Trump there today and then Kamala Harris traveling there this week as well. PAYNE: Right. CRABTREE: I think the most significant thing about that NBC poll is the Hispanic vote. And that is really key, obviously, in Florida. And you have Trump besting Biden with the Hispanic, Latino voters 46 to 50 percent. And he has 50 percent. And it's pretty significant. PAYNE: Yes. Here's the thing, though. It is significant, but I read an article in The Miami Herald where they're worried because the Hispanic vote -- listen, Hillary Clinton got the majority of it, but we know the Cuban voters typically lean Republican. Many of them like President Trump. And it's hard to turn out. I think it's the ability to get these voters to actually come out and vote is where the sticky part is. And President Trump today, with this environmental move, he's kind of keeping the Biden campaign off their focus, I think, and sort of off-kilter a little bit. And the door-to-door effort, I think, could be one of the deciding factors that's not getting a lot of publicity. CRABTREE: Yes, I think the -- with this COVID time, I think it's completely unprecedented. And the mail-in voting is going to be key across the country. You have more mail-in voting than we have ever seen before, and a lot of distrust in The Postal Service as well, so, both of those factors, really unprecedented situation. But you still see -- I mean, that is so significant with the Latino voters in Florida, whereas Hillary Clinton, back in 2016, she led with Latino voters 62-35 percent for Trump, and Trump still managed to pull off a win there with 120,000 votes, very, very slim one in Florida. PAYNE: Right. Right. CRABTREE: And Florida is extremely key for him. He has to win Florida with its 29 electoral votes. PAYNE: Absolutely. Susan, thank you very much. It's 56 days, but it feels like we're going to be talking about this every day. You can feel the anxiety out there. Meanwhile, D.C. stimulus talks are stalling, Wall Street obviously selling, with the Nasdaq now in correction territory. That means it's down 10 percent from the recent high. So, is Main Street worrying? We will be right back. PAYNE: The Senate is back in action today. And Senate Republicans are trying to get a new relief bill going, this as the Nasdaq has collapsed in just three sessions into correction territory. I want to go to FOX's Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the very latest -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Charles. Well, the Senate Republicans, they have struggled all summer long to try to get 51 Republican senators to coalesce around a coronavirus bill. We don't know that they have it just yet. But there's going to be a procedural vote on this bill that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, released today. That's going to be on Thursday. And, basically, what McConnell is doing here, he is daring Senate Democrats to vote against this bill. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Maybe they will bring back their Goldilocks act and say, our multi-hundred-billion-dollar proposal is too small or too skinny, even though Democrats just passed a piecemeal bill for The Postal Service. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, this bill cost $300 billion. That's cheap, considering they were discussing more than $1 trillion a few days ago. It includes liability reform tied to coronavirus and an extra $300 in cash each week for those off the job. Now, Democrats don't like this bill at all. In fact, Patrick Leahy, Democratic senator from Vermont, was just on the Senate floor a few moments ago. And he described this bill as -- quote -- ""anemic."" Keep in mind that this bill is really designed by the Senate Republican leadership to give Republicans who are facing competitive reelection bids in swing states air cover to show, Charles, that they can vote for something on coronavirus this fall. Somebody else who is in cycle this fall who has to show that he's fighting to deal with coronavirus is Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader -- back to you. PAYNE: Chad, thank you very much. Meanwhile, Wall Street, it keeps reeling, as Washington keeps getting nowhere with COVID relief, the Nasdaq, as I mentioned, now in correction territory. I want to bring in market watcher Kathryn Rooney Vera on whether or not investors are going to get any relief from this sell-off. You know, Kathryn Rooney Vera, it is intriguing that the Congress and Washington, D.C., they do seem to pay attention when the market starts to collapse, don't they? KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS: Yes, that's a real problem for them. And that gets some -- that gets them going. Let's just say it that way. Certainly, there is going to be some form of stimulus in the pipeline. It's very unlikely that consumption levels can maintain themselves at the current pace, Charles, with slightly under 10 percent unemployment. Heretofore, consumption has been largely based on government stimuli, for better or for worse. And I suspect that more is in the very near-term pipeline. PAYNE: So, then, what do you make of it, though? Because they started off $2 trillion apart. And now we have got this so-called skinny bill, which I know may appease certain folks who are in elections right now and other conservatives who are worried about debt and deficits. But, by the same token, can you realistically say to the country, hey, we want to have enough money for more small businesses, to help schools reopen, to take care of liabilities? I don't know if they're going in the right direction, and the clock is ticking. ROONEY VERA: Well, Charles, we're still trying to digest $2.7 trillion of stimulus as a reaction to COVID. And we're in de facto a V-shaped recovery. So, if we're to debate whether or not a stimulus is actually required, I think that's a very, very credible debate. But we're not, unfortunately. Both Republicans and Democrats are -- instead of debating the irresponsibility of our fiscal status, we're talking about not if we should, but the magnitude of the next stimulus bill. We haven't even digested the first one. PAYNE: Well, to your point earlier, though, we would not have had consumption if it wasn't for the stimulus bill. I mean, I think that's pretty obvious... ROONEY VERA: Yes. PAYNE: ... that people wouldn't have spent money if they didn't know checks were coming, if they didn't know relief was coming. Now that people know it's not coming, they're going to be probably sitting on -- our savings rate is the third highest level it's ever been. So, if people start to sit on the meager amounts of money they already have, and everyone starts to pull back as we go into the winter, I'm not sure how that's a positive recipe for the economy. ROONEY VERA: But what at cost -- at what cost, Charles? And I think this gets into a bit of an ideological debate, but there is a phenomenon called crowding out of the private sector by the government sector. And you have another thing called creative destruction. So I do believe we need to let the free markets work. And there's one statistic that I always turn to, Charles. And that's that 30 percent of personal income now comes from government benefits. Is that a place that we want to be in the United States? Is that the direction that we want to continue to turn? And right now, consumption has been primarily, as you mentioned, driven by stimuli, when, more likely than not, it should be run by the private sector and the government reducing itself in size, rather than augmenting its size. PAYNE: Yes. No, no, it's a tough one. If it wasn't for this one -- once-in-every-hundred-year plague and this forced government lockdown, I might be in lockstep with you. (LAUGHTER) PAYNE: But, on this one, I think Congress is making a mistake. And I think people with jobs are underestimating how painful it is for people whose job went out of business. Like, your business you worked at does not exist anymore, and an economist is telling you to toughen up, don't worry about it, the free market is there. It's not. My business is gone. It's not. They won't let me open the restaurant. There is no real free enterprise or free markets when you have so much more and so many of these outside exogenous factors. And that's what worries me, is that Congress is going to let this thing get a lot worse, and then they're going to pass something that's really going to make the fiscal conservatives upset. ROONEY VERA: But don't you think then, Charles, that we shouldn't be subsidizing the major conglomerates? The Federal Reserve is buying in the secondary market bonds from Apple and from GE -- from GM. These are subsidized national champions. We see this in the emerging markets. So, my contention is, corporate socialism isn't something that we want to dabble with. So, I agree that we need to have some improvement with regard to enhancing refinancing to small and medium businesses. But that hasn't been the case. It's been to the benefit of the major conglomerates. PAYNE: Yes. Yes. That's been a side issue that -- it's sincere. And I think a lot of it had to do with the urgency factor of getting this stuff out there. But the clock is ticking. Kathryn Rooney Vera, always a pleasure. ROONEY VERA: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, eight weeks out, President Trump says he will step in with his own campaign cash, if he has to. The fallout from that is next. PAYNE: Talk about indigestion. Forget about making reservations at your favorite New York restaurant. A new survey showing more than half of restaurants across the state could be gone for good. That means never coming back. We will be back in 60 seconds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We have much more money than we had last time going into the last two months, I think double and triple. But if we needed any more, I would put it up personally, like I did in the primaries last time. In the 2016 primaries, I put up a lot of money. If I have to, I will do it here. But we don't have to, because we have double and maybe even triple what we had a number of years ago, four years ago. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: President Trump considering putting some of his own money into the 2020 race. How big of a deal is that? Let's ask Democratic strategist Jenna Arnold, Axios reporter Stef Kight, and GOP strategist Joseph Pinion. Joe, Joseph, what do you think? Is that a sign of desperation or a sign of his commitment to winning? JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, look, I think it's a sign of his commitment to say that he's in this to the end. But I also think it's a psychic nod and a wink to that donor class. I think, when you take someone out to dinner, no one ever really wants to reach into their pocket and spend their own money. And even billionaires running for president don't want to spend their own money when they're running for president. But I think it's a message to those other billionaires and to also those grassroots supporters that say that, hey, give until it hurts. We're in for the fight of our lives right now. PAYNE: You know, Jenna, it's interesting. For years, Democrats used to complain about the money Republicans had. And now the Democrats seem to be the ones who are awash in cash. What difference will it make with the outcome? JENNA ARNOLD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I assume that it will ultimately have a significant impact in terms of on-air and online buys targeting swing voters. So, heading into the final months, it's a bit -- it's a significant flag that the Democrats are doing so well, and Trump is signaling to his community that he needs help. PAYNE: And, Stef, of course, if you go back to the prior election, Hillary Clinton significantly spent more money than then candidate Trump. And we saw what the results were. Is it more about organization these days, commitment from volunteers than it is about absolute cash? STEF KIGHT, AXIOS: I mean, cash is always going to be important. And you're right that, in 2016, Hillary Clinton raised far more -- far more funds than Donald Trump did. And it's interesting, because, going into 2020, it was looking like Donald Trump really would have had the edge when it comes to cash flow, when it comes to having the money and resources available to really go hard this election cycle. So, it is significant that he's now saying that he would consider putting his own money into it. And the fact that, while he is committed to winning, it also does show that Democrats have had -- made quite some progress over the past few months in raising funds, that Biden had a significant haul in August, record-setting numbers of funds coming in. So, while money isn't the only thing that matters these days, and being able to use social media and other tactics that maybe aren't as expensive... PAYNE: Right. KIGHT: ... money is still going to be a significant factor here. PAYNE: And, to be clear, Biden just recently -- the Biden/Harris ticket just recently started to push hard, whereas President Trump has been raising a lot of money. Both sides -- we're going to shatter all records. We know that. I want to kind of switch gears here because of what's happening in these major cities across the United States, President Trump and Joe Biden both addressing these protests over the past week. Now, in Rochester, New York just saw -- Rochester, New York, just recently, just a few moments ago, the police chief there resigned, this in the wake of these uprisings over the death of Daniel Prude. And, Joe, he took the entire command team. They're all gone. The mayor says she has no idea who's in charge. I mean, we're seeing just pure anarchy. And so how does this impact the election, Joe? PINION: I mean, look, we're clearly a nation in pain. But we have to remind ourselves that retribution is not justice. Vengeance is not atonement. And when people like John Lewis are talking about getting into good trouble, good trouble is not mirroring the type of intimidation tactics that black people took to the streets and took to lunch counters to try to drive out of society. So, you cannot in any way think that you're going to mirror the ugliness you seek to cure the world of and think that you're going to build the future that we all deserve. So, I think, right now, President Trump is leaning into the fact that you can expect more of this if you were to elect a Biden and Harris ticket. And I think the reality is, as I have said many times, that every time a business burns, a new Trump supporter is born. But now I think every time a family has to flee a restaurant in terror, you're dealing with the fact that those never-Trumpers might find themselves running back into the warm embrace of Donald Trump. PAYNE: Jenna, it feels like Joe Biden's having a difficult time, because he's walking his thin line. He wants to say he's for law and order. He also has been really reluctant to critique some of the violence that we're seeing, and many Democrats saying, hey, there was some survey taken of some sort of evidence that only 7 percent of these things were violent. I mean, that's a big number, right? We're talking about dozens and dozens of instances where either Molotov cocktails are thrown or even issues where -- that Joe just referenced -- where people are having a dinner and they're chased out of the restaurant and humiliated. I mean, aren't you concerned about that? ARNOLD: I think the outstanding question that we all need to stay very disciplined in asking is, why are all of these protests happening to begin with? Martin Luther King did -- gracefully explained that peace is not the absence of tension, but it's the presence of justice. Folks that are taking to the streets are infuriated, not just about the amount of people who consistently have their lives taken away from them at the hands of law enforcement and systematic violence, but whose voice just continue to be neglected by those who have been put in power. So I think the real outstanding question is, are these people being heard? Are they being responded to? And, yes, I don't condone, as a Quaker, any sort of violence, be it at a glass window or any sort of aggravated verbal violence, but I think it's a reflection of all of the cracks in the system, be it in Rochester or Portland. PAYNE: Right. ARNOLD: I think anything that falls under the law and order umbrella needs to be examined with a very, very big magnifying glass. PAYNE: You know, do I have time for Stef? I'm sorry. Sorry. We got to leave it there. Listen, real quick, Stef, listen, that answer is what infuriates me. I know 57 years personally of the frustrations that black people are dealing with. I just don't know that chasing people out of restaurants or violence is -- I think that muffles the message, which, by the way, is resonating, if you let it resonate. KIGHT: Absolutely. I think there are a lot of American voters who agree with you and who see the violence in some of these cities and see the destruction. And that is going to influence their vote in November. They are watching that. And we're seeing in the polls that more and more Americans are saying that law and order and the unrest that we're seeing in these cities is going to be a significant factor for them in November. And we have seen both sides take advantage of this. We have seen Donald Trump continue to tout law and order. And we have also seen Joe Biden come out and say that he does not support... PAYNE: Yes. All right, well, it's really an amazing time in this country. And thank you all very much for this panel. In the meantime, we're going to talk about partying in a pandemic. Another major university suspends in classes -- in-person classes, this as it would like to keep its students and kids safer on campus and send them home. But is that the right answer? We have got a top doctor who does have the answers next. PAYNE: Class dismissed. West Virginia University putting a temporary hold on in-person classes, after a slew of outbreaks and fears that partying over the weekend will cause even more. So, is this the right move, to keep students on campus, instead of sending them home? Joining me now, Johns Hopkins University Physician Dr. Marty Makary. Dr. Makary, all these universities seem to be grappling with this. Some people believe that, while the cases are high, there have been zero hospitalizations and that sending students home may be an overreaction. What do you think is the right course here? DR. MARTY MAKARY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: Well, I agree, Charles, we don't want infected students in our airports, sharing bathrooms with limited ventilation in ride-share services, going through the TSA and traveling. It's just not a good idea. It's not good for public health. It creates more vectors of transmission. So, dispersing 500 kids back into the United States through modes of -- multiple modes of transportation is bad for public health. And at the University of West Virginia, there's now 500 students after just a week of classes that are positive, and the positivity rate has gone from 1 to 14 percent. So, we need to address it, but they need to stay put. They need to find a place where they can quarantine. And they need to not travel, until their symptoms resolve. And, of course, in the interim, if they get very sick, that's when they go straight to a doctor or an emergency room. PAYNE: Yes, I mean, we see sort of like the NBA thing with the bubble, if you will. I mean, I guess these campuses are going to become de facto bubbles, and maybe also experiments in herd immunity of sorts. MAKARY: It's amazing. The schools are doing a tremendous job, not just grade schools and high schools, but colleges, in putting all the precautionary measures in place. But all of that falls apart, Charles, with the off-campus parties. And we're seeing the spread primarily in the older age group. It's not from the classroom itself. And if you look at the age distribution of the transmission, it's not grade schools. It's not even the early part of junior high schools. It's the off-campus congregate settings. So I think schools need to recognize people that have COVID-19, they're not -- it's not leprosy in biblical times. You don't just shoo them away. You have got a responsibility to the community. PAYNE: Yes. And I guess, if we're going to be realistic, they're just not going to stop partying. Perhaps there's a way to keep them on campus. But they're just -- I just don't know how you stop them, if they're allowed to leave campus, from partying. MAKARY: Well, schools have traditionally had one heavy lever, and that is to kick somebody out of school. It's time maybe for them to not just scatter parties, but to create some accountability and say, look, we're serious. For the time being, we don't want people gathering in these congregate settings. Most students are doing the right thing. They're making tremendous personal sacrifices. PAYNE: Right. MAKARY: But it's a small group that ruins it for the larger student body. PAYNE: Well, sir, always appreciate your invaluable insight. Thank you very much. In the meantime, while the school situation remains fluid here, across the pond and in the United Kingdom, students are returning to class for the first time in months. FOX's Benjamin Hall has the latest from London. BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Charles. There's an overwhelming consensus here that there's more risk to keep children out of school than it is to send them back. And so we have seen 99.7 percent of schools here in the U.K. return to class. There are precautions in place. There are the bubbles set up to make sure that year groups don't overlap. There are start times staggered. And in those COVID hot spots in the U.K., high school kids will have to wear masks in communal areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: But not in the classroom, because that's clearly nonsensical. You can't teach with face coverings. (END VIDEO CLIP) HALL: It is widely accepted that coronavirus poses a very small risk to children. But most experts agree, overwhelmingly, that if children don't return to school, there will be widespread long-term negative to learning and psychological health. Nine out of 10 parents say they feel safe sending their children back. But, as you know, Charles, this is not only about education. It's about the economy. If you get the children back, you can get their parents back into the work force. And that, at least here in the U.K., has been a major issue -- Charles. PAYNE: Benjamin Hall, thank you very much. And with politics getting injected into the race for the COVID-19 vaccine, several major drug companies doing something to make sure that the public feels safe. We will explain next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Biden and his very liberal running mate should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's said so many things that aren't true, I'm worried, if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: As the coronavirus becomes a 2020 election issue, a group of drug company CEOs are pledging that their COVID-19 vaccines will follow the full regulatory path. With me now is former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan. Mark, the need -- I think it's really intriguing that four competing companies all in the race for the COVID-19 vaccine thought they had to join together to reassure the public that this is going to be a safe and effective manner that's always been part of the FDA process. I mean, are you surprised that they -- that it's come to this? DR. MARK MCCLELLAN, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: Well, Charles, this is a very important time for the country. And the vaccines are critical to effectively emerging from the pandemic. So, here we are, just a couple of months before the election, a lot of rhetoric. And I think what you're seeing from the companies, you're also going to see from other people. Former FDA commissioners, like me, have all been saying the same thing. The FDA has a very good process in place that they intend to apply here to make sure the vaccines that are approved for use are safe and effective for the people who are getting them. And that's really important, so that Americans can have confidence to use the vaccines and get us out of the pandemic. PAYNE: The FDA process, in and of itself, has been criticized by many for a long time. It's the toughest in the world. It takes a long time. You can spend billions of dollars. You got phase one, phase two, phase three, new drug application. And then you only get to sell the drug before -- a few years before they rip you off with the generic version. So, with this Operation Warp Speed,rMD-BO_ has it truncated the process without taking away the integrity of the process? MCCLELLAN: Well, I wouldn't say it's truncated the process. And I know, when you -- when people hear words like Operation Warp Speed, they think of something going fast, maybe too fast for safety. But, Charles, what's really happened with the vaccine process is that several things that usually happen one after the other are happening at the same time, thanks in part because FDA has laid out some very clear expectations that they want to see a vaccine that is shown to significantly reduce COVID and its severity in a large number of patients before it can be used. So, they put out that guidance. The National Institutes of Health, working with the companies, have set up some very large clinical trials, 30,000 people or more. They're enrolling very fast. A number those are under way. More are starting the next month for at least six vaccines over the next few months. That's unprecedented. And also unprecedented is, at the same time, the government is going in jointly with the manufacturers on these vaccines to commit to a large-scale supply, tens, hundreds of millions of doses that will be ready to go when or soon after the vaccines are actually approved, when they meet those FDA safety standards. Normally, all those things happen one after the other, with a lot of uncertainty. Because this is COVID, they're all happening at the same time. So, it's not cutting corners, as much as it's doing things that used to be done sequentially all at the same time. PAYNE: OK. I'm thrilled you cleared that up, because I was not -- I wasn't sure until now. Ironically, it makes me feel better about this. But we do have a large swathe of the population, at least a third of Americans, who say they won't take it. Whose job is it, whose responsibility is it, the government, drug companies, to sort of reassure the public that this is something worth doing? Because there are a lot of skeptics out there. MCCLELLAN: Well, there are a lot of skeptics out there. Even before COVID, there are a lot of people who are skeptical of vaccines, even though FDA's track record on vaccines is one of a very high level of safety and one that should deserve a lot of confidence. So, this is another challenge for all of us, Charles, who are involved in this, people like you who are talking to the American public every day, the FDA getting out a very clear understanding to the public of all of these steps that they're going through to make sure vaccines are safe and effective before they're used, as well as other experts, medical professionals. I understand that people have a lot of questions because of the political environment we're in now. But it's very important to look at the facts and look at what FDA is actually doing to make sure that the COVID vaccines are safe and effective. And I think, if we support the FDA in doing what they are expert and very well prepared to do, people should have confidence in the vaccine. It's still going to be a big effort to communicate to the American public about what's gone into vaccine development and how and why they should make decisions to use the vaccines. PAYNE: All right, sir. Well, you're right. It's going to be a big uphill battle, but we appreciate you coming on. And you certainly helped me out a lot today. I appreciate it. In the meantime, folks, you are looking live at New York City. Your table? Still not ready. And, according to a new survey, your favorite restaurant could actually be making its last call for good. PAYNE: Point, click, clean. The next big tech trend during COVID-19 could be a big game-changer for businesses across the country. To Jeff Flock in Vernon Hills, Illinois, with the very latest -- Jeff. JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Disinfecting, Charles, people as they enter various venues in this disinfection booth. Right now, I'm getting about as disinfected as I can be. This is atomized disinfectant here. I'm also getting ozone now coming down from the ceiling of this, as well as what they call far-UVC, ultraviolet light, doesn't hurt you, but does kill the virus. Got the people here who have developed it, the president and CEO of the company developing this. Can you run me through this, Jason, if you would? I'm going to give you the microphone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure. FLOCK: I will stand here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. So, obviously, you put your face in front of the silhouette. It read your temperature, and now it's giving you an approval to enter into the device. FLOCK: I can go in here. Now, I go in. What do I do? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, raise your arms. And you want to take about a six- to-eight-second turn. So, this way, you're avoiding any shadowing, so the light can disinfect you. And you have -- as you mentioned, you have got that ozone above you at three parts per million. You have got far-UVC, which is 99.97 percent effective, and atomized disinfectant. FLOCK: Now, just to be clear, this isn't curing coronavirus. What this is doing is keeping any of the virus that's on my hands and on my person in any way from coming into an already sanitized location. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we make front-line-of-defense products. Companies are going to spend a lot of money disinfecting their -- their companies, and that costs a lot of money. But, as soon as you open up the door, the real threat is the people. They're dragging in that RNA. FLOCK: Gotcha. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And there needs to be technology and devices to prevent... (CROSSTALK) FLOCK: This is already in use extensively in the UAE, Charles. Overseas countries have been early adopters on this. Dina (ph), tell me. In the U.S., you have some folks that have already purchased and are operating these. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, we do. We have over at the Las Vegas Venetian globe shop. And then we're also installing them at SeatGeek Stadium here in Bridgeview. FLOCK: And you have got now universities also, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, quite a few of the different districts have been talking to us readily. I think, with this, it'll help close quite a few of those deals. (LAUGHTER) FLOCK: Sorry. And, again, Charles, this is disinfectant, I can get this on me. This is not -- this is ingestible, FDA-approved, as well as the light, as well as the ozone. Anything you can do to try and make the environment safer, I think, is going to be a positive out there -- Charles. PAYNE: Oh, yes, safety is the word. That's for sure. Jeff Flock, thank you very much. And from cleaning up to getting cleaned out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): You also know that, when we opened indoor dining in Upstate New York, we had issues. When we opened indoor dining, we had clusters in Upstate New York. This is not without risk. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo talking about the dangers of reopening indoor dining, this with a new survey showing that nearly two- thirds of New York state restaurants could close for good if they don't get another round of COVID-19 economic relief. Let's get the read on this from Nassau County Executive Laura Curran. Laura, I got to say, I'm reading where your county in Long Island has been really aggressive, where New York state, particularly New York City, has not. And you have put out some ads. You have talked about taste Nassau today, dine where it's fine in Long Island. All seem to be deliberate shots at New York City, Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio saying, hey, you know, we're letting at least 50 percent -- our restaurants open, at least 50 percent of them. Why do you feel it's so much safer? And what do you think the economic consequences are going to be? LAURA CURRAN, NASSAU COUNTY, NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE: Hi, Charles. It's wonderful to be with you again. And I'm very happy to talk about our fabulous restaurants in Nassau County. So, we're the first county on Long Island just to the side of New York City. And we want to encourage people to come for much more than pizza and bagels. We have got fabulous restaurants. We do have indoor dining, 50 percent capacity. And this is really important. It's important to give people a chance to go out, share a meal with family, with friends, with loved ones. And it's also important because it keeps a lot of people working. We need to get this economy going again. I have been an advocate for businesses to reopen and to reopen safely. And I think our numbers have shown (INAUDIBLE) hospitalization (INAUDIBLE). We have been opening now (INAUDIBLE) reopened more than 100 days. And in that 100 days, our rates have only gone down. So, I think we're going to do what we can (INAUDIBLE) and do it safely. PAYNE: No, it's a beacon, actually, for a lot of folks in New York City, particularly these restaurant owners. I had a restaurant owner on my show last week. And she's desperate. All of them are saying, we're OK. We have got the sidewalk thing working for us, the pickup stuff, the takeout stuff, but without the ability to go indoors, particularly as it gets cooler, we're going to go out of business. I mean, you must speak with the governor. I'm sure you have conversations with Bill de Blasio. Do they ask you about the success that you're experiencing? And, obviously, from the first moment that this occurred, you took a more pro-business approach toward all of this. CURRAN: You know, I visited a lot, I visited malls, I visited gyms, I visited bowling alleys and advocated for their safe reopening. I just did a big tour of movie theaters and saw all of the protocols, independent small movie theaters, big chains, looking at the protocols that they have in place. And I'm confident that, when they can reopen, they can do it safely. That's the key. We're proving that we can do it. We need the economy to come back strong. We need to get that revenue going, getting people working, keeping them working. It's very important for all of us. People say, we're all in this together. Our businesses are a very important part of that. PAYNE: Have you had a chance, though, to speak with the governor about this at all? Has he asked about your success and maybe using it as something of a template for the rest of the state? CURRAN: Sure. We speak with our partners at the state all of the time, advocating for businesses to be able to open in a commonsense way. We always get a good reception. And this is an ongoing process. I think everyone, whatever their municipality or their responsibilities are, want to keep people safe. That's my goal too. My goal is also to show that we can reopen and reopen in a way that is safe. We all know those commonsense protocols, the mask, the social distancing. We know they work. We know they're simple. And we know that we can be nimble and readjust things. PAYNE: I feel like this is a matter of trust, that you trust businesses to do the right thing, that you trust all of these other folks to do the right thing. And it's proven out. You have given them the green light. They're doing it. Your cases have gone down. People have kept their jobs. And everyone's moving out of New York City to Nassau County. Thank you very much, Laura. CURRAN: Thank you. PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, President Trump heading to North Carolina for a rally today, Joe Biden hitting the battleground state of Michigan tomorrow. Folks, the race is heating up, with only eight weeks left. Neil will be back tomorrow. You can also, though, catch me 2:00 p.m. Eastern on the FOX Business Network.
